</i></p><hr>s of this formula, I should like to state here 
distinctly that the interpretation of the <b>p.</b> given here as comprising 3 
successive lives not only agrees with all the different schools of Buddhism and 
all the ancient commentaries, but also is fully identical with the explanations 
given already in the canonical suttas. Thus, for example, it is said verbatim in 
Nidāna-Samyutta (S. XII, 51): "Once ignorance (1) and clinging (9) are 
extinguished, neither karmically meritorious, nor demeritorious, nor 
imperturbable karma-formations (2=10) are produced, and thus no consciousness 
(3=11) will spring up again in a new mother's womb." And further: "For, if 
consciousness were not to appear in the mother's womb, would in that case 
mentality and corporeality (4) arise?" Cf. above diagram.</p><p>The purpose of the Buddha in teaching the<b> p.</b> was to show to suffering 
mankind how, depending on ignorance and delusion, this present existence and 
suffering has come about, and how through extinction of ignorance, and of the 
craving and clinging conditioned thereby, no more rebirth will follow, and thus 
the standstill of the process of existence will have been realized and therewith 
the extinction of all suffering.</p><hr><p>(3.) "Through consciousness are conditioned corporeality and mentality" <i>
  (viññāna-paccayā nāma-rūpani). </i>This proposition implies that without 
  consciousness there can be no mental and physical process of existence. By 
  mentality <i>(nāma)</i> is here to be understood the karma-resultant <i>(vipāka)</i> 
  mental phenomena, such as feeling<i> (vedanā),</i>
  perception <i>(saññā), </i>volition <i>(cetanā:</i> non-karmical volition is 
  here meant), consciousness-impression<i> (phassa), </i>advertence <i>
  (manasikāra)</i>
  (M. 9; S. XII, 2). For the basic 7 mental phenomena inseparably associated with 
  every state of consciousness, s. <i><a href="naama.htm">nāma</a>.</i> By 
  corporeality <i>(rūpa)</i> is meant the 4 physical elements (s. <i><a href="../b_f/dhaatu.htm">
  dhātu</a>)</i> and the corporeality dependent thereon (s.<i> <a href="../g_m/khandha.htm">
khandha,</a></i><a href="../g_m/khandha.htm"> I</a>).</p><p>Mentality is always conditioned through consciousness; i.e. consciousness <i>
(viññāna)</i> is for mentality <i>(nāma)</i> a condition by way of conascence <i>
(sahajāta), </i>mutuality <i>(aññamañña),</i>
association <i>(sampayutta), </i>etc., since the 4 mental groups at all times 
form an inseparable unit.</p><p>Consciousness <i>(viññāna)</i> is for corporeality <i>(rūpa)</i>
a condition by way of co-nascence only at the moment of conception, thereafter a 
condition by way of post-nascence <i>(pacchājāta-paccaya; <a href="paccaya.htm">
paccaya</a></i><a href="paccaya.htm"> 11</a>) and nutriment <i>(āhāra), </i>i.e. 
as a support. Just as the repeatedly arising hunger is a condition and support 
for the pre-arisen body, so is the consciousness arising afterwards a condition 
and support for the maintenance of this pre-arisen body.</p><hr><p>(4.) "Through mentality and corporeality are conditioned the 6 bases <i>
  (nāma-rūpa paccayā salāyatanam).</i> The 6 bases are a name for the 5 physical 
sense-organs and, as 6th, the mind-base (<i>manāyatana</i>), i.e. consciousness.</p><p>Mentality <i>(nāma;</i> s. 3) is for the 5 physical bases <i>(āyatana),
</i>or sense-organs, a condition by way of post-nascence. Cf. end of 3.</p><p>Mentality <i>(nāma),</i> i.e. feeling. etc., is for the 6th base, or 
consciousness - as being always inseparably associated therewith a condition by 
way of co-nascence. etc.</p><p>Corporeality <i>(rūpa),</i> here the 4 elements, are for the 5 physical bases <i>
(āyatana),</i> or sense-organs, a condition by way of support <i>(nissaya).</i></p><p>Corporeality <i>(rūpa), </i>here the 5 physical sense-organs, are for the 6th 
base <i>(āyatana), </i>i.e. consciousness, a condition by way of support and 
pre-nascence <i>(purejāta-paccaya)</i>.</p><hr><p>(5.) "Through the 6 bases is conditioned the (sensorial and mental) 
  impression" <i>(salāyatana-paccayā phasso),</i> for without the 5 physical 
  bases, or sense-organs, there can be no sense-impressions; and without the 6th 
base, or consciousness, there can be no mental impression.</p><p>Thus, the 5 physical bases, eye, etc., are for the corresponding 5 
sense-impressions (visual impression, etc.) a condition by way of support <i>
(nissaya)</i> and pre-nascence<i> (purejāta),</i> whereas the 6th, the mind-base 
(consciousness), is for the mental impression a condition by way of co-nascence, 
association, mutuality, etc.</p><hr><p>(6.) "Through impression is conditioned feeling" <i>(phassa-paccayā vedanā), </i>
  i.e. the sensorial and the mental impressions are for the feeling associated 
therewith a condition by way of co-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.</p><hr><p>(7.) "Through feeling is conditioned craving" <i>(vedanā-paccayā tanhā). </i>
  Any (karma-resultant) feeling, whether agreeable, disagreeable or neutral, 
  bodily or mental, past or expected, may become for craving a condition of 
  decisive support by way of object <i>(ārammanūpanissaya).</i> Even physically 
  and mentally painful feeling may, through the desire to be released there from, 
  become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object <i>
(ārammanupanissaya)</i>.</p><hr><p>(8.) "Through craving is conditioned clinging" <i>(tanhā-paccayā upādānam).</i> 
'Clinging' is explained as an intensified form of craving. It is of 4 kinds:  </p><ul>
      <li>(1) clinging to sensuality, </li>
      <li>(2) to erroneous views, </li>
      <li>(3) to rules and ritual, </li>
      <li>(4) to personality-belief. </li>
    </ul><p>Sensuous craving is to (1) a condition of natural decisive support <i>
(pakatupanissaya). </i>For (2-4), craving is a condition by way of co-nascence, 
mutuality, root <i>(hetu), </i>etc. It also may be a condition of natural 
decisive support. For example, through craving for heavenly rebirth, etc. people 
often may be induced to cling to certain rules and rituals, with the hope of 
reaching thereby the object of their desires.</p><hr><p>(9.) "Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming" <i>
  (upādāna-paccayā bhavo),</i> i.e. the wholesome and unwholesome active 
  karma-process of becoming (<i>kamma-bhava</i>), as well as the karma-resultant<i> 
  (vipāka) </i>passive process, the so-called 'rebirth-process' <i>
  (upapatti-bhava).</i> The karma-process <i>(kammabhava) </i>comprises the 5 
  karmical causes: ignorance, karma-formations, craving, clinging, karma-process 
  (s. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, of the diagram); the rebirth-process <i>(upapatti-bhava)
</i>comprises the 5 karma-results (s. 3-7 of the diagram).</p><p>The karma-process is here, correctly speaking, a collective name for 
generative karmic volition <i>(kamma-cetanā)</i> and all the mental phenomena 
associated therewith, whilst the 2nd link (karma-formations) designates only 
karmic volition (s. <i><a href="../a/aayuuhana.htm">āyūhana</a>).</i> Both, 
however, i.e. the 2nd and 10th proposition, practically state one and the same 
thing, namely, that karma is the cause of rebirth, as we shall see under 10.</p><p>Clinging <i>(upādāna)</i> may be an inducement of decisive support <i>
(upanissaya)</i> to many kinds of wholesome and unwholesome karma. Sensuous 
clinging <i>(kāmūpādāna), </i>i.e. clinging to sensuous objects, for example, 
may be a direct inducement to murder, theft, unlawful intercourse with the other 
sex, evil words and thoughts, etc. Clinging to rules and ritual <i>
(sīlabbatūpādāna)</i>
may lead to self-complacency, fanaticism, cruelty, etc. Clinging is also for the 
evil karma associated therewith, a condition by way of co-nascence, association, 
etc.</p><hr><p>(10.) "Through the process of becoming is conditioned rebirth" <i>
  (bhava-paccayā jāti), </i>i.e. through the wholesome and unwholesome 
  karma-process <i>(kamma-bhava)</i> is conditioned the rebirth-process <i>
  (upapatti-bhava).</i> The 2nd and 10th propositions, as already pointed out, 
  practically teach one and the same thing, namely, that karma is the cause of 
  rebirth; in other words, that the karmical volition <i>(cetanā)</i>
  is the seed out of which springs the new life, just as from the mango-seed is 
generated the new mango-tree.</p><p>Hence, the 5 karmical causes (ignorance, etc.) of the past birth are the 
condition for the karma-results of the present birth; and the 5 karmical causes 
of the present birth are the condition for the 5 karma-results of the next birth 
(s. diagram). As it is said in Vis.M. XVII:</p><blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <div>
            <dt>"Five causes were there in the past,</dt>
          </div>
          <div>
            <dt>Five fruits we find in present life;</dt>
          </div>
          <div>
            <dt>Five causes do we now produce,</dt>
          </div>
          <div>
            <dt>Five fruits we reap in future life."</dt>
          </div>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote><p>Now, just as in this process of continually changing mental and bodily 
phenomena, nothing can be found that would pass from one moment to the next 
moment, so also there is no enduring entity, ego, or personality, within this 
process of existence that would transmigrate from one life to the next (s.<i> 
nāma-rūpa, anattā, patisandhi, khandha). </i>"No being and no living soul passed 
from the former life to this life, and yet this present embryo could not have 
entered into existence without the preceding causes" (Vis.M. XVII). "Many things 
may serve to illustrate this fact, as for example the echo, the light of a lamp, 
the impression of a seal, or the image produced by a mirror" (ib.).</p><p>"Whosoever is in the dark with regard to the conditionally arisen things, and 
does not understand that karma originates from ignorance, etc., he thinks that 
it must be his ego that knows or does not know, acts and causes to act, and that 
arises at rebirth. Or he thinks that the atoms, or a creator, with the help of 
this embryonic process, must have formed this body, or that it is the ego 
endowed with faculties that has impressions, feels, desires, clings, continues 
and enters again into existence in a new birth. Or he thinks that all beings 
have been born through fate, or fortuitously" (Vis.M. XVII).</p><p>Now, on hearing that Buddhism teaches that everything whatever in the world 
is determined by conditions some might come to the conclusion that Buddhism 
teaches some sort of fatalism, and that man has no free will, or that will is 
not free.</p><p>The problem 'whether man has a free will' does not exist for, the Buddhist, 
since he knows that, apart from these ever-changing mental and physical 
phenomena, no such entity as 'man' can be found, and that 'man' is merely a name 
not relating to any reality. And the question, 'whether will is free', must be 
rejected for the reason that 'will', or volition, is a mental phenomenon 
flashing forth only for a moment, and that as such it had not any existence at 
the preceding moment. For of a thing which is not, or is not yet, one cannot, 
properly speaking, ask whether it is free or un-free. The only admissible 
question would be whether the arising of 'will' is independent of conditions, or 
whether it is conditioned. But the same question would equally apply also to all 
the other mental phenomena, as well as to all physical phenomena, in other 
words: to everything and every occurrence whatever. And the answer would be: 
whether will arises, or whether feeling arises, or whether any other mental or 
any physical phenomenon arises, the arising of anything whatsoever is dependent 
on conditions, and without conditions nothing ever can arise or enter into 
existence.</p><p>According to Buddhism, everything mental or physical happens in accordance 
with laws and conditions; and if it were otherwise, chaos and blind chance would 
reign. But such a thing is impossible and contradicts all laws of thinking. Cf. 
Fund. III (end).</p><hr><p>(11.) "Through rebirth are conditioned old age and death" <i>(jātipaccayā 
  jarā-maranam). </i>Without birth there can be no old age and death, no suffering 
  and misery. Thus rebirth is to old age and death, etc. a condition by way of 
decisive support <i>(upanissaya)</i>.</p><p>The Buddha has said (D.15): "Profound, Ananda. is this dependent origination, 
and profound does it appear. It is through not understanding, not penetrating, 
this law that this world resembles a tangled ball of thread, a bird's nest, a 
thicket of sedge or reed, and that man does not escape from the lower states of 
existence, from the course of woe and perdition, suffering from the round of 
rebirth." And further (M. 28): 'Whoso understands the dependent origination 
understands the Dhamma; and whoso understands the Dhamma understands the 
dependent origination."</p><hr><font size="2">
