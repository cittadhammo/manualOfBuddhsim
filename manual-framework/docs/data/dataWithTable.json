(Vibh. II). Similar is the explanation \nof the four remaining physical sense-organs.\nMind-base (manāyatana) is a collective term for all consciousness \nwhatever, and should therefore not be confounded with the mind-element (mano-dhātu; \ns.  dhātu II, 16), which latter performs \nonly the functions of adverting (āvajjana) to the sense-object, and of \nreceiving (sampaticchana) the sense-object. On the functions of the mind, \ns. viññāna-kicca.\nThe visible object (rūpāyatana) is described in Vibh. II as \"that \nphenomenon which is built up of the four physical elements and appears as color, \netc.\" What is' seen by-visual perception, i.e. by eye-consciousness (cakkhu-viññāna) \nare colors and differences of light, but not three dimensional bodily things.\n'Mind-object-base' (dhammāyatana) is identical with \n'mind-object-element' (dhamma-dhātu; s.  \ndhātu II) and \ndhammārammana (s. ārammana). It may be physical or mental, past, \npresent or future, real or imaginary.\nThe 5 physical sense-organs are also called faculties (indriya), \nand of these faculties it is said in M. 43: \"Each of the five faculties owns a \ndifferent sphere, and none of them partakes of the sphere of another one; ... \nthey have mind as their support... are conditioned by vitality, ... but vitality \nagain is conditioned by heat, heat again by vitality, just as the light and \nflame of a burning lamp are mutually conditioned.\"\nThe 12 bases are fully discussed in Vis.M. XV. In Yam III (s Guide, p 98f) \nthe 12 terms are subjected to a logical investigation The six personal bases \nform the 5th link of dependent origination (paticca-samuppāda \n5).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Such an exercise, though appearing quite \nmechanical, if properly carried out will bring about a high degree of mental \nconcentration and entrance into the 4 absorptions (jhāna). \nIn the 3rd and 4th exercises the monk by an external kasina-object gains the \nmental reflexes and absorptions. As objects of the remaining exercises, \nperfectly clear and radiant colours should be chosen, flowers, cloth, etc.\nA kasina-object of small size is said to be suitable for a mentally unsteady \nnature, one of a large size for a dull nature, a beautiful object for an angry \nnature, an ugly one for a lustful nature.\nIn Vis.M. V it is said: \"By means of the earth-kasina one succeeds in \nreaching the stage of mastery with regard to small and large objects .... By \nmeans of the blue-kasina one succeeds in causing blue forms to appear, in \nproducing darkness, in reaching the stage of mastery with regard to beautiful \nand ugly colours, in reaching 'deliverance through the beautiful', etc.\" (cf. \nvimokkha II, 3).

Limited space, under the name of ākāsa-dhātu\n(space element), belongs to derived corporeality (s. \nkhandha, Summary I; Dhs 638) and to a six \nfold classification of elements (s. \ndhātu; M.112, M.115, M.140). It is also an \nobject of kasina meditation. It is defined as \nfollows: \"The space element has the characteristic of delimiting matter. Its \nfunction is to indicate the boundaries of matter. It is manifested as the \nconfines of matter; or its manifestation consists in being untouched (by the 4 \ngreat elements), and in holes and apertures. Its proximate cause is the matter \ndelimited. It is on account of the space element that one can say of material \nthings delimited that 'this is above. below, around that' \" (Vis.M. XIV.63).\n2. Endless space is called in Atthasālini ajatākāsa, 'unentangled', \ni.e. unobstructed or empty space. It is the object of the first immaterial \nabsorption (s. jhāna), the sphere of \nboundless space (ākāsānañcāyatana). According to Abhidhamma philosophy, \nendless space has no objective reality (being purely conceptual), which is \nindicated by the fact that it is not included in the triad of the wholesome (kusalatika), \nwhich comprises the entire reality. Later Buddhist schools have regarded it as \none of several unconditioned or uncreated states (asankhata dharma) - a \nview that is rejected in Kath. (s. Guide. p. 70). Theravāda Buddhism recognizes \nonly Nibbāna as an unconditioned element (asankhata-dhātu: s. Dhs. \n1084).\n\n\n    \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The 'Discourse \non Mindfulness of Breathing' (Ānāpānasati Sutta, M. 118) and other texts have 16 \nmethods of practice, which divide into 4 groups of four. The first three apply \nto both tranquillity (samatha) and insight-meditation, while the \nfourth refers to pure insight practice only. The second and the third group \nrequire the attainment of the absorptions.\n\"With attentive mind he breathes in, with attentive mind he breathes out.\n\n  I.

      "bodyContent": "\n\n\n  \n    anattā\n  \n\n'not-self', non-ego, egolessness, impersonality, \n\nis the last of the three characteristics of existence (ti-lakkhana, q.v.) \nThe anattā doctrine teaches that neither within the bodily and mental \nphenomena of existence, nor outside of them, can be found anything that in the \nultimate sense could be regarded as a self-existing real ego-entity, soul or any \nother abiding substance. \n This is the central doctrine of Buddhism, without understanding which a real \nknowledge of Buddhism is altogether impossible. It is the only really specific \nBuddhist doctrine, with which the entire Structure of the Buddhist teaching \nstands or falls. All the remaining Buddhist doctrines may, more or less, be \nfound in other philosophic systems and religions, but the anattā-doctrine \nhas been clearly and unreservedly taught only by the Buddha, wherefore the \nBuddha is known as the anattā-vādi, or 'Teacher of Impersonality'. \n\nWhosoever has not penetrated this impersonality of all existence, and does not \ncomprehend that in reality there exists only this continually self-consuming \nprocess of arising and passing bodily and mental phenomena, and that there is no \nseparate ego-entity within or without this process, he will not be able to \nunderstand Buddhism, i.e. the teaching of the 4 Noble Truths (sacca, \nq.v.), in the right light. He will think that it is his ego, his personality, \nthat experiences suffering, his personality that performs good and evil actions \nand will be reborn according to these actions, his personality that will enter \ninto Nibbāna, his personality that walks on the Eightfold Path. Thus it is said \nin Vis.M. XVI:\n \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;\n          \n          \n            The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;\n          \n          \n            Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;\n          \n          \n            The path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"\n          \n        \n         \n      \n    \n  \n\n\"Whosoever is not clear with regard to the conditionally arisen phenomena, \nand does not comprehend that all the actions are conditioned through ignorance, \netc., he thinks that it is an ego that understands or does not understand, that \nacts or causes to act, that comes to existence at rebirth .... that has the \nsense-impression, that feels, desires, becomes attached, continues and at \nrebirth again enters a new existence\" (Vis.M. XVII. 117).\nWhile in the case of the first two characteristics it is stated that all \nformations (sabbe sankhārā) are impermanent and subject to suffering, the \ncorresponding text for the third characteristic states that \"all things are \nnot-self\" (sabbe dhammā anattā; M. 35, Dhp. 279). This is for emphasizing \nthat the false view of an abiding self or substance is neither applicable to any \n'formation' or conditioned phenomenon, nor to Nibbāna, the Unconditioned Element \n(asankhatā dhātu).\nThe Anattā-lakkhana Sutta, the 'Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-self', \nwas the second discourse after Enlightenment, preached by the Buddha to his \nfirst five disciples, who after hearing it attained to perfect Holiness (arahatta).\nThe contemplation of not-self (anattānupassanā) leads to the emptiness \nliberation (suññatā-vimokkha, s. vimokkha). Herein the faculty of \nwisdom (paññindriya) is outstanding, and one who attains in that way the \npath of Stream-entry is called a Dhamma-devotee (dhammānusāri; s. \nariya-puggala); at the next two stages of sainthood he becomes a \nvision-attainer (ditthippatta); and at the highest stage, i.e. Holiness, \nhe is called 'liberated by wisdom' (paññā-vimutta).\nFor further details, see paramattha-sacca, paticca-samuppāda, khandha, \nti-lakkhana, nāma-rūpa, patisandhi.\n\n  \n    Literature: Anattā-lakkhana Sutta, Vinaya I, 13-14; S.22. 59; tr. in \n\tThree Cardinal Discourses of the Buddha (WHEEL 17). - \n  \n    \n    Another important text on Anattā is the Discourse on the Snake Simile \n\t(Alagaddūpama Sutta, M. 22; tr. in WHEEL 48/49) . \n  \n     Other texts in \"Path\". - Further: Anattā and Nibbāna, by Nyanaponika \n\tThera (WHEEL 11); \n  \n     The Truth of Anattā, by Dr. G.

It is from the fact of impermanence that, in most texts, the other two \ncharacteristics, suffering (dukkha) and not-self (anattā), are \nderived (S.22. 15; Ud.IV. I)\n\"Impermanence of things is the rising, passing and changing of things, or the \ndisappearance of things that have become or arisen. The meaning is that these \nthings never persist in the same way, but that they are vanishing dissolving \nfrom moment to moment\" (Vis.M. VII, 3).\nImpermanence is a basic feature of all conditioned phenomena, be they \nmaterial or mental, coarse or subtle, one's own or external: All formations are \nimpermanent\" (sabbe sankhārā aniccā; M. 35, Dhp. 277). That the totality \nof existence is impermanent is also often stated in terms of the five aggregates \n(khandha, q.v.), the twelve personal and external sense bases (āyatana \nq.v.), etc. Only Nibbāna (q.v.), which is unconditioned and not a formation (asankhata), \nis permanent (nicca, dhuva).\nThe insight leading to the first stage of deliverance, Stream-entry (sotāpatti; \ns. ariya-puggala), is often expressed in terms of impermanence: \"Whatever \nis subject to origination, is subject to cessation\" (s. Dhammacakkappavattana \nSutta, S.46. 11). In his last exhortation, before his Parinibbāna, the Buddha \nreminded his monks of the impermanence of existence as a spur to earnest effort: \n\"Behold now, Bhikkhus, I exhort you: Formations are bound to vanish. Strive \nearnestly!\" (vayadhammā sankhārā, appamādena sampādetha; D. 16).\nWithout the deep insight into the impermanence and insubstantiality of all \nphenomena of existence there is no attainment of deliverance. Hence \ncomprehension of impermanence gained by direct meditative experience heads two \nlists of insight knowledge: \n\n  \n     (a) contemplation of impermanence (aniccānupassanā) is the first \n\tof the 18 chief kinds of insight (q.v.); \n  \n     (b) the contemplation of arising and vanishing (udayabbayānupassanā-ñāna) \n\tis the first of 9 kinds of knowledge which lead to the 'purification by \n  knowledge and vision of the path-progress' (s. visuddhi, VI). - \n\n\nContemplation of impermanence leads to the conditionless deliverance (animitta-vimokkha;\ns. vimokkha). As herein the faculty of confidence (saddhindriya) \nis outstanding, he who attains in that way the path of Stream-entry is called a \nfaith-devotee (saddhānusārī; s. ariya-puggala) and at the seven \nhigher stages he is called faith-liberated (saddhā-vimutta), - See also \nanicca-saññā.\n    See The Three Basic Facts of Existence I: Impermanence (WHEEL 186/187)\n\n    \n\n       \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

This Community of the \nBlessed One's disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of \ngifts, worthy of reverence with raised hands, the unsurpassed field for doing \nmeritorious deeds.'\n(4) \"The noble disciple further recollects his own morality (sīla) which is \nunbroken, without any breach, undefiled, untarnished, conducive to liberation, \npraised by the wise, not dependent (on craving or opinions), leading to \nconcentration.\n(5) \"The noble disciple further recollects his own liberality (cāga) \nthus: 'Blessed truly am I, highly blessed am I who, amongst beings defiled with \nthe filth of stinginess, live with heart free from stinginess, liberal, \nopen-handed, rejoicing in giving, ready to give anything asked for, glad to give \nand share with others.'\n(6) \"The noble disciple further recollects the heavenly beings (devatā): \n'There are the heavenly beings of the retinue of the Four Great Kings, the \nheavenly beings of the World of the Thirty-Three, the Yāmadevas ... and there \nare heavenly beings besides (s. \ndeva). Such faith, such morality, such \nknowledge, such liberality, such insight, possessed of which those heavenly \nbeings, after vanishing from here, are reborn in those worlds, such things are \nalso found in me.' \" (A. III,70; VI,10; XI,12).\n\"At the time when the noble disciple recollects the Perfect One ... at such a \ntime his mind is neither possessed of greed, nor of hate, nor of delusion. Quite \nupright at such a time is his mind owing to the Perfect One ... With upright \nmind the noble disciple attains understanding of the sense, understanding of the \nlaw, attains joy through the law. In the joyous one rapture arises. With heart \nenraptured, his whole being becomes stilled. Stilled within his being, he feels \nhappiness; and the mind of the happy one becomes firm. Of this noble disciple it \nis said that amongst those gone astray, he walks on the right path, among those \nsuffering he abides free from suffering. Thus having reached the stream of the \nlaw, he develops the recollection of the Enlightened One....\" (A.VI.10).\nIn A.I.21 (PTS: I, xvi) and A.I.27 (PTS: xx. 2) another 4 recollections are \nadded:  \n\n  mindfulness on death (marana-sati), \n  \n  on the body (kāyagatā-sati), \n  on breathing (ānāpāna-sati), and \n  the recollection of peace (upasamānussati).\n\nThe first six recollections are fully explained in Vis.M.

By 'fruition' (phala) is \nmeant those moments of consciousness which follow immediately thereafter as the \nresult of the path, and which in certain circumstances may repeat for \ninnumerable times during the life-time.\n\n  (I) Through the path of Stream-winning (sotāpatti-magga) one \n  'becomes' free (whereas in realizing the fruition, one 'is' free) from the \n  first 3 fetters (samyojana) which \n  bind beings to existence in the sensuous sphere, to wit:\n  \n    (1) personality-belief (sakkāya-ditthi; s. \n    ditthi), \n    (2) skeptical doubt (vicikicchā),\n    \n    (3) attachment to mere rules and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa; s.\n    upādāna).\n  \n  \n  \n  (II) Through the path of Once-return (sakadāgāmi-magga) \n  one becomes nearly free from the 4th and 5th fetters, to wit:\n  \n    (4) sensuous craving (kāma-cchanda = kāma-rāga; s. \n    rāga), \n    (5) ill-will (vyāpāda = dosa, s. \n    mūla).\n  \n  \n  \n  (III) Through the path of Non-return (anāgāmi-magga) \n  one becomes fully free from the above-mentioned 5 lower fetters.\n  \n  (IV) Through the path of Holiness (arahatta-magga) \n  one further becomes free from the 5 higher fetters, to wit:\n  \n    (6) craving for fine material existence (rūpa-rāga), \n    (7) craving for immaterial existence. (arūpa-rāga), \n    (8) conceit (māna), \n    (9) restlessness (uddhacca),\n    \n    (10) ignorance (avijjā).\n  \n  \n\nThe stereotype Sutta text runs as follows:\n\n  (I) \"After the disappearance of the three fetters, the monk has won the \n  stream (to Nibbāna) and is no more subject \n  to rebirth in lower worlds, is firmly established, destined for full \n  enlightenment.\n  (II) \"After the disappearance of the three fetters and reduction of greed, \n  hatred and delusion, he will return only once more; and having once more \n  returned to this world, he will put an end to suffering.\n  (III) \"After the disappearance of the five fetters he appears in a higher \n  world, and there he reaches Nibbāna without ever returning from that world (to \n  the sensuous sphere).\n  (IV) \"Through the extinction of all cankers (āsava-kkhaya) he \n  reaches already in this very life the deliverance of mind, the deliverance \n  through wisdom, which is free from cankers, and which he himself has \n  understood and realized.\"\n\nFor the various classes of Stream-winners and Non-Returners, s. \nSotāpanna, Anāgāmī.\n(B) The sevenfold grouping of the noble disciples is as follows:\n\n  (1) the faith-devotee (saddhānusārī), \n  (2) the faith-liberated one (saddhāvimutta), \n  (3) the body-witness (kāya-sakkhī), \n  (4) the both-ways-liberated one (ubhato-bhāga-vimutta), \n  (5) the Dhamma-devotee (dhammānusārī), \n  (6) the vision-attainer (ditthippatta), \n  (7) the wisdom-liberated one (paññā-vimutta). \n\nThis group of seven noble disciples is thus explained in Vis.M. XXI, 73:\n\n  (1) \"He who is filled with resolution (adhimokkha) and, in \n  considering the formations as impermanent (anicca), gains the faculty \n  of faith, he, at the moment of the path to Stream-winning (A.1) is called a \n  faith-devotee (saddhānusārī); \n  (2) at the seven higher stages (A. 2-8) he is called a faith-liberated one \n  (saddhā-vimutta). \n  (3) He who is filled with tranquility and, in considering the formations \n  as miserable (dukkha), gains the faculty of concentration, he in every \n  respect is considered as a body-witness (kāya-sakkhī). \n  (4) He, however, who after reaching the absorptions of the immaterial \n  sphere has attained the highest fruition (of Holiness), he is a \n  both-ways-liberated one (ubhato-bhāga-vimutta). \n  (5) He who is filled with wisdom and, in considering the formations as \n  not-self (anattā), gains the faculty of wisdom, he is at the moment of \n  Stream-winning a Dhamma-devotee (dhammānusārī), \n  (6) at the later stages (A. 2-7) a vision-attainer (ditthippatta),\n  \n  (7) at the highest stage (A. 8) a wisdom-liberated one (paññāvimutta).\"\n  \n\nFurther details about the body-witness, the both-ways-liberated one and the \nwisdom-liberated one, s. under the three Pāli terms. Cf. also M. 70; A. IX, 44; \nS. XII, 70; Pts.M. II, p. 33, PTS.\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ignorance is defined as 'not \nknowing the four truths, namely, suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the \nway to its cessation' (S. XII, 4).\n \nAs ignorance is the foundation of all life-affirming actions, of all evil and \nsuffering, therefore it stands first in the formula of Dependent Origination (paticca-samuppāda). \nBut for that reason, says Vis.M. (XVII, 36f) ignorance should not be regarded as \n\"the causeless root-cause of the world ... It is not causeless. For a cause of \nit is stated thus 'With the arising of cankers (āsava) \nthere is the arising of ignorance' (M. 9). But there is a figurative way in \nwhich it can be treated as a root-cause; namely, when it is made to serve as a \nstarting point in an exposition of the Round of Existence ... As it is said: 'No \nfirst beginning of ignorance can be perceived, Bhikkhus, before which ignorance \nwas not, and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that ignorance \nhas its specific condition (idappaccaya)\" (A.X.61). The same statement is \nmade (A.X.62) about the craving for existence (bhava-tanhā; s. \ntanhā). The latter and ignorance are called \"the outstanding causes of \nkamma that lead to unhappy and happy destinies\" (Vis.M. XVII, 38).\n \nAs ignorance still exists - though in a very refined way until the attainment \nof Arahatship or Holiness, it is counted as the last of the 10 fetters (samyojana) \nwhich bind beings to the cycle of rebirths. As the first two roots of evil, \ngreed and hate (s. mūla), are on their \npart rooted in ignorance, consequently all unwholesome states of mind are \ninseparably bound up with it. Ignorance (or delusion) is the most obstinate of \nthe three roots of evil.\nIgnorance is one of the cankers (āsava) and \nproclivities (anusaya). It is often called a \nhindrance (nīvarana; e.g. in S.XV.3; A.X.61) but does not appear together \nwith the usual list of five hindrances.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

One has to \ndistinguish 2 kinds:  \n\n  development of tranquillity (samatha-bhāvanā), i.e. concentration (samādhi), \n  and \n  development of insight (vipassanā-bhāvanā), i.e. wisdom (paññā).\n\nThese two important terms, tranquillity and insight (s. \nsamatha-vipassanā), are very \noften met with and explained in the Sutta, as well as in the Abhidhamma.\nTranquillity (samatha) is the concentrated, unshaken, peaceful, and \ntherefore undefiled state of mind, whilst insight (vipassanā) is the \nintuitive insight into the impermanence, misery and impersonality (anicca, \ndukkha, anattā; s. tilakkhana) \nof all bodily and mental phenomena of existence, included in the 5 groups of \nexistence, namely, corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and \nconsciousness; s. \nkhandha.\nTranquillity, or concentration of mind, according to Sankhepavannana \n(Commentary to Abhidhammattha-sangaha), bestows a threefold blessing: favourable \nrebirth, present happy life, and purity of mind which is the condition of \ninsight. Concentration (samādhi) is the indispensable foundation and \nprecondition of insight by purifying the mind from the 5 mental defilements or \nhindrances (nīvarana), whilst insight \n(vipassanā) produces the 4 supra mundane stages of holiness and \ndeliverance of mind. The Buddha therefore says: \"May you develop mental \nconcentration, o monks; for who is mentally concentrated, sees things according \nto reality\" (S.XXII.5). And in Mil. it is said: \"Just as when a lighted lamp is \nbrought into a dark chamber, the lamp-light will destroy the darkness and \nproduce and spread the light, just so will insight, once arisen, destroy the \ndarkness of ignorance and produce the light of knowledge.\"\nVis.M. III-XI gives full directions how to attain full concentration and the \nabsorptions (jhāna) by means of the \nfollowing 40 meditation subjects (kammatthāna):\n\n  \n10 kasina-exercises (s. kasina). These \nproduce the 4 absorptions\n  \n  \n10 loathsome subjects (asubha). These \nproduce the 1st absorption.\n  \n  \n10 recollections (anussati):  \n\n  of the Buddha (buddhānussati), \n  \n  the Doctrine (dhammānussati), \n  the Brotherhood of the Noble Ones (sanghānussati), \n  \n  morality, \n  liberality, \n  the heavenly beings, \n  death (maranasati), \n  the body (kāyagatāsati), \n  in-and-out breathing (ānāpāna-sati)\n  peace (upasamānussati). \n  \n\nAmong these, the recollection (or mindfulness) of in-and-out breathing may \nproduce all the 4 absorptions, that of the body the 1st absorption, the rest \nonly neighbourhood-concentration (upacāra-samādhi, s. \nsamādhi).\n  \n  \n4 sublime abodes (brahma-vihāra): \n \n\n\n  loving-kindness (mettā)\n  compassion (karunā)\n  altruistic joy (muditā)\n  equanimity (upekkhā). \n\nOf these, the first 3 exercises may produce 3 absorptions, the last one the \n4th absorption only.\n  \n  \n4 immaterial spheres (arūpāyatana, s. \njhāna): \n\n  of unbounded space, \n  unbounded consciousness, \n  nothingness, \n  neither-perception-nor-non-perception. \n\nThese are based upon the 4th absorption.\n  \n  \n1 perception of the loathsomeness of food (āhāre patikkūla-saññā), \nwhich may produce neighbourhood-concentration\n  \n  \n1 analysis of the 4 elements (catudhātu-vavatthāna, s.\ndhātu-vavatthāna), which may produce \nneighbourhood-concentration.\n  \n\nMental development forms one of the 3 kinds of meritorious action (puñña-kiriya-vatthu).  \n'Delight in meditation' (bhāvanā-rāmatā) is one of the noble usages (ariya-vamsa) \n.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Herein, since time immemorial, all impressions and \nexperiences are, as it were, stored up, or better said, are functioning, but \nconcealed as such to - full consciousness, from where however they occasionally \nemerge as subconscious phenomena and approach the threshold of full \nconsciousness, or crossing it become fully conscious. This so-called \n'subconscious life-stream' or undercurrent of life is that by which might be \nexplained the faculty of memory, paranormal psychic phenomena, mental and \nphysical growth, karma and rebirth. etc. An alternative rendering is \n'life-continuum'.\nIt should be noted that bhavanga-citta is a karma-resultant state of \nconsciousness (vipāka, q.v.), and that, in birth as a human or in higher \nforms of existence, it is always the result of good, or wholesome karma (kusala-kamma-vipāka), \nthough in varying degrees of strength (s. patisandhi, end of the \narticle). The same holds true for rebirth consciousness (patisandhi) and \ndeath consciousness (cuti), which are only particular manifestations of \nsubconsciousness. In Vis.M. XIV it is said:\n\n\"As soon as rebirth-consciousness (in the embryo at the time of conception) \n  has ceased, there arises a similar subconsciousness with exactly the same \n  object, following immediately upon rebirth-consciousness and being the result of \n  this or that karma (volitional action done in a former birth and remembered \n  there at the moment before death). And again a further similar state of \n  subconsciousness arises. Now, as long as no other consciousness arises to \n  interrupt the continuity of the life-stream, so long the life-stream, like the \n  flow of a river, rises in the same way again and again, even during dreamless \n  sleep and at other times. In this way one has to understand the continuous \n  arising of those states of consciousness in the life-stream.\" \n\nCf. \n  viññāna-kicca. For more details, s. Fund. 11.

The faith (saddhā) \nof a lay follower of the Buddha is described as \"he believes in the \nenlightenment of the Perfect One\" (saddahati Tathāgatassa bodhim: M.53, \nA.III.2).\nAs components of the state of enlightenment and contributory factors to its \nachievement, are mentioned in the texts: the 7 factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga \n= bodhi-anga) and the 37 'things pertaining to enlightenment' (bodhipakkhiya-dhammā). \nIn one of the later books of the Sutta-Pitaka, the Buddhavamsa, 10 \nbodhipācana-dhammā \nare mentioned, i.e. qualities that lead to the ripening of perfect \nenlightenment; these are the 10 perfections (pāramī).\nThere is a threefold classification of enlightenment:  \n\n  1. that of a noble disciple (sāvaka-bodhi, q.v.). i.e. of an \n  Arahat, \n  2. of an Independently Enlightened One (pacceka-bodhi, q.v.), and \n  3. of a Perfect Enlightened One (sammā-sambodhi). \n  \n\nThis 3-fold division, however, is of later origin, and in this form it \nneither occurs in the canonical texts nor in the older Sutta commentaries. The \nclosest approximation to it is found in a verse sutta which is probably of a \ncomparatively later period, the Treasure Store Sutta (Nidhikkanda Sutta) of the \nKhuddakapātha, where the following 3 terms are mentioned in stanza 15: \nsāvaka-pāramī, pacceka-bodhi, buddha-bhūmi \n(see Khp. Tr., pp. 247f.).\nThe commentaries (e.g. to M., Buddhavamsa, Cariyapitaka) generally give a \n4-fold explanation of the word bodhi:  \n\n  1. the tree of enlightenment, \n  2. the holy path (ariya-magga), \n  3. Nibbāna, \n  4 omniscience (of the Buddha: sabbaññutā-ñāna). \n\nAs to (2), the commentaries quote Cula-Nidesa where bodhi is defined \nas the knowledge relating to the 4 paths (of Stream-entry, etc.; catūsu \nmaggesu ñāna).\nNeither in the canonical texts nor in the old commentaries is it stated that \na follower of the Buddha may choose between the three kinds of enlightenment and \naspire either to become a Buddha, a Pacceka-Buddha, or an Arahat-disciple. This \nconception of a choice between three aspirations is, however, frequently found \nin present-day Theravāda countries, e.g. in Sri Lanka.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Amongst the first 2 classes will be reborn \n  those with experience of the 4th absorption, but amongst the 3rd class only \n  Anāgāmis (q.v.).\n\nIII. The 4 grades of heavenly beings of the immaterial sphere\n(arūpāvacara or arūpa-loka) are:  \n    \n      the heavenly beings of the sphere of unbounded space \n\t  (ākāsānañcāyatanūpaga-devā), \n      of unbounded consciousness (viññānañcāyatanūpaga-deva), \n      of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatanūpaga devā), \n      of neither-perception-nor- non-perception \n\t  (nevasaññā-nāsaññāyatanūpaga-devā). \n\t  Here will be reborn those with experience of the 4 immaterial spheres \n\t  (arūpāyatana;\ns. jhāna \n      5-8).\n\n    See Gods and the Universe by Francis Story (WHEEL 180/181).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

These are strict observances \nrecommended by the Buddha to monks as a help to cultivate contentedness, \nrenunciation, energy and the like. One or more of them may be observed for a \nshorter or longer period of time.\n\"The monk training himself in morality should take upon himself the means of \npurification, in order to gain those virtues through which the purity of \nmorality will become accomplished, to wit: fewness of needs, contentedness, \nausterity, detachment, energy, moderation, etc.\" (Vis.M. II).\nVis.M. II describes 13 dhutangas, consisting in the vows of\n\n  1. wearing patched-up robes: pamsukūlik'anga,\n  2. wearing only three robes: tecīvarik'anga,\n  3. going for alms: pindapātik'anga,\n  4. not omitting any house whilst going for alms: \n  sapadānikanga,\n  5. eating at one sitting: ekāsanik'anga,\n  6. eating only from the alms-bowl: pattapindik'anga,\n  7. refusing all further food: khalu-pacchā-bhattik'anga,\n  8. living in the forest: āraññik'anga,\n  9. living under a tree: rukkha-mūlik'anga,\n  10. living in the open air: abbhokāsik'anga,\n  11. living in a cemetery: susānik'anga,\n  12. being satisfied with whatever dwelling: \n  yathā-santhatik'anga,\n  13. sleeping in the sitting position (and never lying down):\n  nesajjik'anga.\n\nThese 13 exercises are all, without exception, mentioned in the old sutta \ntexts (e.g. M. 5, 113; A.V., 181-90), but never together in one and the same \nplace.\n\"Without doubt, o monks, it is a great advantage to live in the forest as a \nhermit, to collect one's alms, to make one's robes from picked-up rags, to be \nsatisfied with three robes\" (A.I, 30).\nThe vow, e.g. of No. 1, is taken in the words: \"I reject robes offered to me \nby householders,\" or \"I take upon myself the vow of wearing only robes made from \npicked-up rags.\" Some of the exercises may also be observed by the lay-adherent.\nHere it may be mentioned that each newly ordained monk, immediately after his \nbeing admitted to the Order, is advised to be satisfied with whatever robes, \nalms-food, dwelling and medicine he gets: \"The life of the monks depends on the \ncollected alms as food ... on the root of a tree as dwelling ... on robes made \nfrom patched-up rags ... on stale cow's urine as medicine. May you train \nyourself therein all your life.\"\nSince the moral quality of any action depends entirely upon the accompanying \nintention and volition, this is also the case with these ascetic practices, as \nis expressly stated in Vis.M. Thus the mere external performance is not the real \nexercise, as it is said (Pug. 275-84): \"Some one might be going for alms; etc. \nout of stupidity and foolishness - or with evil intention and filled with \ndesires - or out of insanity and mental derangement - or because such practice \nhad been praised by the Noble Ones....\" These exercises are, however properly \nobserved \"if they are taken up only for the sake of frugality, of contentedness, \nof purity, etc.\"(App.)\n    On dhutanga practice in modern Thailand, see With Robes and Bowl, by \n\tBhikkhu Khantipalo (WHEEL 82/83).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

'sight'; Ö dis, \nto see): view, belief, speculative opinion, insight.  \n If not qualified by \nsammā, 'right', it mostly refers to wrong and evil view or opinion, and only \nin a few instances to right view, understanding or insight (e.g. \nditthi-ppatta, q.v.; ditthi-visuddhi, purification of insight; \nditthi-sampanna, possessed of insight).\nWrong or evil views (ditthi or micchā-ditthi) \nare declared as utterly rejectable for being a source of wrong and evil \naspirations and conduct, and liable at times to lead man to the deepest abysses \nof depravity, as it is said in A. I, 22:\n\"No other thing than evil views do I know, o monks, whereby to such an extent \nthe unwholesome things not yet arisen arise, and the unwholesome things already \narisen are brought to growth and fullness. No other thing than evil views do I \nknow, whereby to such an extent the wholesome things not yet arisen are hindered \nin their arising, and the wholesome things already arisen disappear. No other \nthing than evil views do I know, whereby to such an extent human beings at the \ndissolution of the body, at death, are passing to a way of suffering, into a \nworld of woe, into hell.\" Further in A. I, 23: \"Whatever a man filled with evil \nviews performs or undertakes, or whatever he possesses of will, aspiration, \nlonging and tendencies, all these things lead him to an undesirable, unpleasant \nand disagreeable state, to woe and suffering.\"\nFrom the Abhidhamma (Dhs) it may be inferred that evil views, whenever they \narise, are associated with greed (s. Tab. I. 22, 23, 26, 27).\nNumerous speculative opinions and theories, which at all times have \ninfluenced and still are influencing mankind, are quoted in the sutta-texts. \nAmongst them, however, the wrong view which everywhere, and at all times, has \nmost misled and deluded mankind is the personality-belief, the ego-illusion. \nThis personality-belief (sakkāya-ditthi), or ego-illusion \n(atta-ditthi),\nis of 2 kinds: eternity-belief and annihilation-belief.\nEternity-belief (sassata-ditthi) is the belief in the existence of a \npersisting ego-entity, soul or personality, existing independently of those \nphysical and mental processes that constitute life and continuing even after \ndeath.\nAnnihilation-belief (uccheda-ditthi), on the other hand, is the belief \nin the existence of an ego-entity or personality as being more or less identical \nwith those physical and mental processes, and which therefore, at the \ndissolution at death, will come to be annihilated. - For the 20 kinds of \npersonality-belief, see sakkāya-ditthi.\nNow, the Buddha neither teaches a personality which will continue after \ndeath, nor does he teach a personality which will be annihilated at death, but \nhe shows us that 'personality', 'ego', 'individual', 'man', etc., are nothing \nbut mere conventional designations (vohāra-vacana) and that in the \nultimate sense (s. paramattha-sacca) \nthere is only this self-consuming process of physical and mental phenomena which \ncontinually arise and again disappear immediately.\nFor further details, s. anattā, \n    khandha,\npaticcasamuppāda.\n\n\"The Perfect One is free from any theory (ditthigata), \nfor the Perfect One has seen what corporeality is, and how it arises and passes \naway. He has seen what feeling ... perception ... mental formations ... \nconsciousness are, and how they arise and pass away. Therefore I say that the \nPerfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, \ndisappearance, rejection and casting out of all imaginings and conjectures, of \nall inclination to the 'vain-glory of 'I' and 'mine.\" (M. 72).\nThe rejection of speculative views and theories is a prominent feature in a \nchapter of the Sutta-Nipāta, the Atthaka-Vagga.\nThe so-called 'evil views with fixed destiny' (niyata-micchāditthi)\nconstituting the last of the 10 unwholesome courses of action (kammapatha), \nare the following three: \n\n  \n(1) the fatalistic 'view of the uncaused ness' of existence \n(ahetukaditthi), \n  \n  \n(2) the view of the inefficacy of action'\n(akiriyaditthi), \n  \n  \n(3) nihilism (natthikaditthi).\n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \n(1) was taught by \nMakkhali-Gosāla, a \ncontemporary of the Buddha who denied every cause for the corruptness and purity \nof beings, and asserted that everything is minutely predestined by fate.\n  \n  \n(2) was taught by \nPūrana-Kassapa, another \ncontemporary of the Buddha who denied every karmical effect of good and bad \nactions: \"To him who kills, steals, robs, etc., nothing bad will happen. For \ngenerosity, self-restraint and truthfulness, etc. no reward is to be expected.\"\n  \n  \n(3) was taught by \nAjita-Kesakambali, a \nthird contemporary of the Buddha who asserted that any belief in good action and \nits reward is a mere delusion, that after death no further life would follow, \nthat man at death would become dissolved into the elements, etc.\n  \n\n    For further details about these 3 views, s. D.2, M.60; commentarial \n\texposition in WHEEL 98/99, P. 23.\nFrequently mentioned are also the 10 antinomies (antagāhikā \nmicchā-ditthi): 'Finite is the world' or 'infinite is the world' ... 'body \nand soul are identical' or 'body and soul are different' (e.g. M. 63).\nIn the Brahmājala Sutta .(D.1), 62 false views are classified and described, \ncomprising all conceivable wrong views and speculations about man and world.\n    See The All-Embracing Net of Views (Brahmājala Sutta), tr. with Com. by \n\tBhikkhu Bodhi (BPS).\n    Further s. D.15, D.23, M.24, D.28; M.11, M.12, M.25, M.60, M.63, M.72, \n\tM.76, M.101, M.102, M.110; A.II.16; A.X.93; S.XXI, S.XXIV; Pts.M. \n\tDitthikathā, etc.\nWrong views (ditthi) are one of the proclivities (s.\nanusaya), cankers (s. \nāsava), clingings (s. \nupādāna), one of the three modes of \nperversions (s. vipallāsa). \nUnwholesome consciousness\n(akusala citta), rooted in greed, may be either with or without wrong \nviews (ditthigata-sampayutta or vippayutta); s.

Hence \n'unsatisfactoriness' or 'liability to suffering' would be more adequate \nrenderings, if not for stylistic reasons. Hence the first truth does not deny \nthe existence of pleasurable experience, as is sometimes wrongly assumed. This \nis illustrated by the following texts:\n\"Seeking satisfaction in the world, monks, I had pursued my way. That \nsatisfaction in the world I found. In so far as satisfaction existed in the \nworld, I have well perceived it by wisdom. Seeking for misery in the world, \nmonks, I had pursued my way. That misery in the world I found. In so far as \nmisery existed in the world, I have well perceived it by wisdom. Seeking for the \nescape from the world, monks, I had pursued my way. That escape from the world I \nfound. In so far as an escape from the world existed, I have well perceived it \nby wisdom\" (A.iii.105).\n\"If there were no satisfaction to be found in the world, beings would not be \nattached to the world .... If there were no misery to be found in the world, \nbeings would not be repelled by the world .... If there were no escape from the \nworld, beings could not escape therefrom\" (A.iii.106).\nSee dukkhatā.

XII).\n\"These 4 roads of power lead to the attaining and acquiring of magical power, \nto the power of magical transformation, to the generation of magical power, and \nto mastery and skill therein\" (Pts.M. II. 205, PTS). For a detailed explanation, \ns. Vis.M. XII.\n\"Once the monk has thus developed and often practised the 4 roads to power, \nhe enjoys various magical powers, ... hears with the divine ear heavenly and \nhuman sounds, ... perceives with his mind the mind of other beings ... remembers \nmany a former existence ... perceives with the divine eye beings passing away \nand reappearing, ... attains, after the extinction of cankers, deliverance of \nmind and deliverance through wisdom, free from. cankers....

For the \n  Arahat, however, impulsion has no longer a karmic, i.e. rebirth-producing \n  character, but is a karmically independent function (kiriya, q.v.; Tab. \n  I, 72-89). There are further 8 supermundane classes of impulsion (Tab. I, 18-21, \n  66-69).\nThe 4 impulsive moments immediately before entering an absorption (jhāna, \nq.v.) or one of the supermundane paths (magga; s.\nariyapuggala) are: the preparatory (parikamma), approach \n(upacāra),\nadaptation (anuloma), and maturity-moment (gotrabhū, q.v.) In \nconnection with entering the earth-kasina absorption (s. kasina), they \nare explained as follows, in Vis.M. IV: \"After the breaking off of the \nsubconscious stream of being (bhavanga-sota, q.v.), there arises the \n'advertence at the mind-door' (manodvārāvajjana, s. viññānakicca), taking as object the earthkasina (whilst thinking), 'Earth! Earth!' \nThereupon, 4 or 5 impulsive moments flash forth, amongst which the last one \n(maturity-moment) belongs to the fine-material sphere (rūpāvacara), \nwhereas the rest belong to the sense-sphere (kāmāvacara; s. avacara),\nthough the last one is more powerful in thought conception, discursive thinking, \ninterest (rapture), joy and concentration (cf. jhāna) than the states of \nconsciousness belonging to the sense-sphere. \nThey are called 'preparatory' \n  (parikamma-samādhi),\n  as they are preparing for the attainment-concentration (appanā-samādhi); \n  'approaching'\n  (upacāra-samādhi), as they are close to the attainment-concentration and \n  are moving in its neighbourhood; 'adaptive' (anuloma), as they adapt \n  themselves to the preceding preparatory states and to the succeeding attainment \n  concentration. The last one of the four is called 'matured' (gotrabhū). \nIn a \n  similar way, the impulsive moments before reaching the divine ear are described \n  in Vis.M. XIII, 1. - Cf. Karma - (App.).\n\n       \n\n\n\n\n",

They are a name for \nthe perception of visible objects, as it is said (Jhāna-Vibh.): 'What are here \nthe perceptions of sense-reactions? They are the perceptions of visible objects, \nsounds, etc.' - Surely, they do no longer exist even for one who has entered the \n1st absorption, etc., for at such a time the five-sense consciousness is no \nlonger functioning. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as having been said \nin praise of this immaterial absorption, in order to incite the striving for it\" \n(Vis.M. X.16).\n\"Perceptions of variety (ñānatta-saññā) are the perceptions that arise \nin various fields, or the various perceptions\" (ib.). Hereby, according to \nVis.M. X.20, are meant the multiform perceptions outside the absorptions.]\n\n \n(6) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless space, and with \nthe idea 'Boundless is consciousness', he reaches the sphere of boundless \nconsciousness (viññānañcāyatana) and abides therein.\n(7) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless consciousness, \nand with the idea 'Nothing is there', he reaches the sphere of nothingness \n(ākiñcaññāyatana) and abides therein.\n(8) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of nothingness he reaches the \nsphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception (nevasaññā-n'asaññāyatana)\nand abides therein.\"\n\"Thus the 1st absorption is free from 5 things (i.e. the hindrances, \nnīvarana), and 5 things are present (i.e. \nthe factors of absorption; jhānanga). Whenever the monk enters the 1st \nabsorption, there have vanished sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, \nrestlessness and scruples, doubts; and there are present: thought-conception \n(vitakka),\ndiscursive thinking (vicāra) rapture (pīti), joy (sukha), \nand concentration (samādhi). In the 2nd absorption there are present: \nrapture, joy and concentration; in the 3rd: joy and concentration; in the 4th: \nequanimity (upekkhā) and concentration\" (Vis.M. IV).\nThe 4 absorptions of the immaterial sphere (s. above 5-8) still belong, \nproperly speaking, to the 4th absorption as they possess the same two \nconstituents. The 4th fine-material absorption is also the base or starting \npoint (pādaka-jhāna, q.v.) for \nthe attaining of the higher spiritual powers (abhiññā).\nIn the Abhidhamma, generally a fivefold instead of a fourfold division of the \nfine-material absorptions is used: the 2nd absorption has still the constituent \n'discursive thinking' (but without thought-conception), while the 3rd, 4th and \n5th correspond to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, respectively, of the fourfold division \n(s. Tab.I. 9- 13) . This fivefold division is based \non sutta texts like A . VIII, 63 .\nFor the 8 absorptions as objects for the development of insight (vipassanā), \nsee  samatha-vipassanā. \n- Full details in Vis.M. IV-X.\nJhāna in its widest sense (e.g. as one of the 24 conditions; s. \npaccaya 17), denotes any, even momentary or weak absorption of mind, \nwhen directed on a single object.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Objective sensuality is, in the canonical texts, mostly called \nkāma-guna, 'cords (or strands) of sensuality'.\n\"There are 5 cords of sensuality: the visible objects, cognizable by \neye-consciousness, that are desirable, cherished, pleasant, lovely, sensuous and \nalluring; the sounds ... smells ... tastes ... bodily impressions cognizable by \nbody-consciousness, that are desirable .... \" (D.33; M.13, 26, 59, 66).\nThese two kinds of kāma are called  \n\n  1. kilesa-kāma,\n  i.e. kāma as a mental defilement, \n  2. vatthu-kāma, i.e. kāma\n  as the object-base of sensuality; first in MNid.. I, p. 1, and frequently in \n  the commentaries.\n\nSense-desire is finally eliminated at the stage of the Non-Returner\n(Anāgāmi; s. ariya-puggala, \nsamyojana).\n\nThe peril and misery of sense-desire is often described in the texts, e.g. in \nstirring similes at M. 22, 54, and in the 'gradual instruction' (s. \nānupubbī-kathā). See further M.13, M.45, M.75; Sn.v.766ff.; Dhp.186, \n215.\nThe texts often stress the fact that what fetters man to the world of the \nsenses are not the sense-organs nor the sense-objects but lustful desire \n(chandarāga).

VIII.2 says \"By repeating the words of this exercise one will become \nwell acquainted with the wording, the mind will not rush here and there, the \ndifferent parts will become distinct and appear like a row of fingers, or a row \nof hedge-poles. Now, just as one repeats the exercise in words, one should do it \nalso in mind. The repeating in mind forms the condition for the penetration of \nthe characteristic marks.... He who thus has examined the parts of the body as \nto colour, shape, region, locality and limits, and considers them one by one, \nand not too hurriedly, as something loathsome, to such a one, while \ncontemplating the body, all these things at the same time are appearing \ndistinctly clear. But also when keeping one's attention fixed outwardly (i.e. to \nthe bodies of other beings), and when all the parts appear distinctly, then all \nmen and animals moving about lose the appearance of living beings and appear \nlike heaps of many different things. And it looks as if those foods and drinks, \nbeing swallowed by them, were being inserted into this heap of things. Now, \nwhile again and again one is conceiving the idea 'Disgusting! Disgusting!' - \nomitting in due course several parts - gradually the attainment - concentration \n(appanā-samādhi, i.e. the concentration of the jhāna)\nwill be reached. In this connection, the appearing of forms ... is called the \nacquired image (uggaha-nimitta), the arising of loathsomeness, however, \nthe counter-image (patibhāganimitta).\"\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And at the end of every hundred years a man should \ncome and rub against it once with a silken cloth. Then that huge rock would wear \noff and disappear quicker than a world-period. But of such world-periods, o \nmonks, many have passed away, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundred \nthousands. And how is this possible?

There is karma (action), o monks, that ripens in \nhell.... Karma that ripens in the animal world.. Karma that ripens in the world \nof men.... Karma that ripens in the heavenly world.... Threefold, however, is \nthe fruit of karma: ripening during the life-time \n(dittha-dhamma-vedanīya-kamma),\nripening in the next birth (upapajja-vedanīya-kamma), ripening in later \nbirths (aparāpariya-vedanīya kamma) ....\" (A.VI.63).\n \nThe 3 conditions or roots (mūla) of \nunwholesome karma (actions) are greed, hatred, delusion (lobha, dosa, moha); \nthose of wholesome karma are: unselfishness (alobha), hatelessness \n(adosa = mettā, good-will), undeludedness (amoha = paññā, knowledge) \n.\n \n\"Greed, o monks, is a condition for the arising of karma; hatred is a \ncondition for the arising of karma; delusion is a condition for the arising of \nkarma ....\" (A.III.112, A.III.34, A.III.147).\n \n\"The unwholesome actions are of 3 kinds, conditioned by greed, or hate, or \ndelusion.\n\"Killing ... stealing ... unlawful sexual intercourse ... lying ... \nslandering ... rude speech ... foolish babble, if practised, carried on, and \nfrequently cultivated, leads to rebirth in hell, or amongst the animals, or \namongst the ghosts\" (A.VIII.40). \n \n\"He who kills and is cruel goes either to hell \n  or, if reborn as man, will be short-lived. He who torments others will be \n  afflicted with disease. The angry one will look ugly, the envious one will be \n  without influence, the stingy one will be poor, the stubborn one will be of low \n  descent, the indolent one will be without knowledge. In the contrary case, man \n  will be reborn in heaven or reborn as man, he will be long-lived, possessed of \n  beauty, influence, noble descent and knowledge\" (cf. M.135).\n \nFor the above 10-fold wholesome and unwholesome course of action, see \nkamma-patha. For the 5 heinous crimes with immediate result, s. \nānantarika-kamma.\n \n\n\"Owners of their karma are the beings, heirs of their karma, their karma is \ntheir womb from which they are born, their karma is their friend, their refuge. \nWhatever karma they perform, good or bad, thereof they will be the heirs\" (M.135).\n \nWith regard to the time of the taking place of the karma-result (vipāka), \none distinguishes, as mentioned above, 3 kinds of karma:\n\n\t1. karma ripening during the life-time (dittha-dhamma-vedanīya \n\tkamma);\n\t2. karma ripening in the next birth (upapajja-vedanīya-kamma);\n\t\n  3. karma ripening in later births (aparāpariya-vedanīya-kamma).\n\n\nThe first two kinds of karma may be without karma-result (vipāka),\nif the circumstances required for the taking place of the karma-result are \nmissing, or if, through the preponderance of counteractive karma and their being \ntoo weak, they are unable to produce any result. In this case they are called \nahosi-kamma,\nlit. 'karma that has been', in other words, ineffectual karma.\n \nThe third type of karma, however, which bears fruit in later lives, will, \nwhenever and wherever there is an opportunity, be productive of karma-result. \nBefore its result has ripened, it will never become ineffective as long as the \nlife-process is kept going by craving and ignorance.\n \nAccording to the Com., e.g. Vis.M. XIX, the 1st of the 7 karmical \nimpulsive-moments (kamma javana; s. javana) is considered as \n'karma ripening during the life-time', the 7th moment as 'karma ripening in the \nnext birth', the remaining 5 moments as 'karma ripening in later births'.\n \nWith regard to their functions one distinguishes:\n\n\t1. regenerative (or productive) karma (janaka-kamma),\n\t2. supportive (or consolidating) karma (upatthambhaka-kamma),\n\t3. counteractive (suppressive or frustrating) karma \n\t(upapīlaka-kamma),\n\t4. destructive (or supplanting) karma (upaghātaka- or\nupacchedaka-kamma).\n\n(1) produces the 5 groups of existence (corporeality, feeling, perception, \nmental formations, consciousness) at rebirth as well as during life-continuity.\n\n\t(2) does not produce karma-results but is only able to maintain the \n\talready produced karma-results.\n\t(3) counteracts or suppresses the karma-results.\n\t(4) destroys the influence of a weaker karma and effects only its own \n\tresult.\n\nWith regard to the priority of their result one distinguishes:\n\n\t1. weighty karma (garuka-kamma),\n\t2. habitual karma (ācinnaka- or bahula-kamma),\n\t3. death-proximate karma (maranāsanna-kamma),\n\t4. stored-up karma (katattā-kamma).\n\n(1, 2) The weighty (garuka) and the habitual (bahula)\nwholesome or unwholesome karma are ripening earlier than the light and \nrarely performed karma. (3) The death-proximate (maranāsanna) karma - \ni.e. the wholesome or unwholesome volition present immediately before death, \nwhich often may be the reflex of some previously performed good or evil action \n(kamma),\nor of a sign of it (kamma-nimitta), or of a sign of the future \nexistence (gati-nimitta) - produces rebirth. (4) In the absence of any of \nthese three actions at the moment before death, the stored-up (katattā) \nkarma will produce rebirth.\n \nA real, and in the ultimate sense true, understanding of Buddhist karma \ndoctrine is possible only through a deep insight into the impersonality (s. \nanattā) and conditionality (s. paticcasamuppāda, paccaya) of all \nphenomena of existence. \"Everywhere, in all the forms of existence ... such a \none is beholding merely mental and physical phenomena kept going by their being \nbound up through causes and effects.\n \n\"No doer does he see behind the deeds, no recipient apart from the \nkarma-fruit. And with full insight he clearly understands that the wise ones are \nusing merely conventional terms when, with regard to the taking place of any \naction, they speak of a doer, or when they speak of a receiver of the \nkarma-results at their arising. Therefore the ancient masters have said:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            'No doer of the deeds is found,\n          \n          \n            No one who ever reaps their fruits;\n          \n          \n            Empty phenomena roll on:\n          \n          \n            This view alone is right and true.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            'And whilst the deeds and their results\n          \n          \n            Roll on, based on conditions all,\n          \n          \n            There no beginning can be seen,\n          \n          \n            Just as it is with seed and tree.' \" (Vis.M. XIX)\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nKarma (kamma-paccaya) is one of the 24 conditions (paccaya) \n(App.: Kamma).\n    Literature:  \n\n\tKarma and Rebirth, by Nyanatiloka (WHEEL 9); \n\tSurvival and Karma in Buddhist Perspective, by K.N.

Whatever there exists of feeling ... of \nperception ... of mental formations ... of consciousness ... all that belongs to \nthe consciousness-group\" (S. XXII, 48). -  \nAnother division is that into the 2 groups:  \n\n  mind (2-5) and \n  corporeality (1) (nāma-rūpa), \n\nwhilst in Dhamma Sanganī, the first book of the Abhidhamma, all the phenomena \nare treated by way of 3 groups:  \n\n  consciousness (5), \n  mental factors (2-4), \n  corporeality (1), in Pāli citta, cetasika, rūpa. Cf. Guide I.\n\nWhat is called individual existence is in reality nothing but a mere process \nof those mental and physical phenomena, a process that since time immemorial has \nbeen going on, and that also after death will still continue for unthinkably \nlong periods of time. These 5 groups, however, neither singly nor collectively \nconstitute any self-dependent real ego-entity, or personality (attā),\nnor is there to be found any such entity apart from them. Hence the belief \nin such an ego-entity or personality, as real in the ultimate sense, proves a \nmere illusion.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \"When all constituent parts are there,\n      \n      \n        The designation 'cart' is used;\n      \n      \n        Just so, where the five groups exist,\n      \n      \n        Of 'living being' do we speak.\" (S. V. 10).\n      \n    \n  \n\nThe fact ought to be emphasized here that these 5 groups, correctly speaking, \nmerely form an abstract classification by the Buddha, but that they as such, \ni.e. as just these 5 complete groups, have no real existence, since only single \nrepresentatives of these groups, mostly variable, can arise with any state of \nconsciousness. For example, with one and the same unit of consciousness only one \nsingle kind of feeling, say joy or sorrow, can be associated and never more than \none. Similarly, two different perceptions cannot arise at the same moment. Also, \nof the various kinds of sense-cognition or consciousness, only one can be \npresent at a time, for example, seeing, hearing or inner consciousness, etc. Of \nthe 50 mental formations, however, a smaller or larger number are always \nassociated with every state of consciousness, as we shall see later on.\n \nSome writers on Buddhism who have not understood that the five khandha \nare just classificatory groupings, have conceived them as compact entities \n('heaps', 'bundles'), while actually, as stated above, the groups never exist as \nsuch, i.e. they never occur in a simultaneous totality of all their \nconstituents. Also those single constituents of a group which are present in any \ngiven body- and -mind process, are of an evanescent nature, and so also their \nvarying combinations. Feeling, perception and mental formations are only \ndifferent aspects and functions of a single unit of consciousness. They are to \nconsciousness what redness, softness, sweetness, etc. are to an apple and have \nas little separate existence as those qualities.\n \nIn S. XXII, 56, there is the following short definition of these 5 groups:\n\"What, o monks, is the corporeality-group? The 4 primary elements \n(mahā-bhūta or dhātu) and corporeality depending thereon, this is \ncalled the corporeality-group.\n\n  \"What, o monks, is the feeling-group? There are 6 classes of feeling: due \n  to visual impression, to sound impression, to odour impression, to taste \n  impression, to bodily impression, and to mind impression....\n  \"What, o monks, is the perception-group? There are 6 classes of \n  perception: perception of visual objects, of sounds, of odours, of tastes, of \n  bodily impressions, and of mental impressions....\n  \"What, o monks, is the group of mental formations? There are 6 classes of \n  volitional states (cetanā): with regard to visual objects, to sounds, \n  to odours, to tastes, to bodily impressions and to mind objects....\n  \"What, o monks, is the consciousness-group? There are 6 classes of \n  consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, \n  tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.\"\n\nAbout the inseparability of the groups it is said:\n''Whatever, o brother, there exists of feeling, of perception and of mental \nformations, these things are associated, not dissociated, and it is impossible \nto separate one from the other and show their difference. For whatever one \nfeels, one perceives; and whatever one perceives, of this one is conscious\" (M. \n43).\n \nFurther: \"Impossible is it for anyone to explain the passing out of one \nexistence and the entering into a new existence, or the growth, increase and \ndevelopment of consciousness independent of corporeality, feeling, perception \nand mental formations\" (S. XII, 53)\n \nFor the inseparability and mutual conditionality of the 4 mental groups s. \npaccaya (6, 7).\nRegarding the impersonality (anattā) and emptiness\n(suññatā) of the 5 groups, it is said in S. XXII, 49:\n\"Whatever there is of corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations \nand consciousness, whether past, present or future, one's own or external, gross \nor subtle, lofty or low, far or near, this one should understand according to \nreality and true wisdom: 'This does not belong to me, this am I not, this is not \nmy Ego.' \"\n \nFurther in S. XXII, 95: \"Suppose that a man who is not blind were to behold \nthe many bubbles on the Ganges as they are driving along; and he should watch \nthem and carefully examine them. After carefully examining them, however, they \nwill appear to him empty, unreal and unsubstantial. In exactly the same way does \nthe monk behold all the corporeal phenomena ... feelings ... perceptions ... \nmental formations ... states of consciousness, whether they be of the past, \npresent or future ... far or near. And he watches them and examines them \ncarefully; and after carefully examining them, they appear to him empty, unreal \nand unsubstantial.\"\n \nThe 5 groups are compared, respectively, to a lump of froth, a bubble, a \nmirage, a coreless plantain stem, and a conjuring trick (S. XXII, 95).\nSee the Khandha Samyutta (S. XXII); Vis.M. XIV.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE 5 GROUPS\nI. Corporeality Group\n\n(rūpa-kkhandha)\n\nA. Underived (no-upādā): 4 elements\n\n  the solid, or earth-element (pathavī-dhātu)\n  the liquid, or water-element (āpo-dhātu)\n    \n    heat, or fire-element (tejo-dhātu)\n    \n    motion, or wind-element (vāyo-dhātu)\n\nB. Derived (upādā): 24 secondary phenomena\n\n  Physical sense-organs of: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, body\n  Physical sense-objects: form, sound, odour, taste, (bodily impacts)\n\n'Bodily impacts' (photthabba) are generally omitted in this list, \nbecause these physical objects of body-sensitivity are identical with the \nafore-mentioned solid element, heat and motion element. Hence their inclusion \nunder 'derived corporeality' would be a duplication.\n\n  femininity (itthindriya)\n    \n    virility (purisindriya)\n    \n    physical base of mind (hadaya-vatthu)\n  bodily expression (kāya-viññatti; s.\n  viññatti)\n    \n    verbal expression (vacī-viññatti)\n    \n    physical life (rūpa jīvita; s. \n\tjīvita)\n    \n    space element (ākāsa-dhātu)\n  physical agility (rūpassa lahutā)\n    \n    physical elasticity (rūpassa mudutā)\n    \n    physical adaptability (rūpassa kammaññatā)\n    \n    physical growth (rūpassa upacaya)\n    \n    physical continuity (rūpassa santati; s. \n    santāna)\n    \n    decay (jarā)\n  impermanence (aniccatā)\n  nutriment (āhāra)\n\nII. Feeling Group\n\n(vedanā-kkhandha)\n\nAll feelings may, according to their nature, be classified as 5 kinds:\n\n  bodily agreeable feeling sukha = kāyikā sukhā vedanā\n\n  bodily painful feeling dukkha = kāyikā dukkhā vedanā\n\n  mentally agreeable feeling somanassa = cetasikā sukhā vedanā\n\n  mentally painful feeling domanassa = cetasikā dukkhā vedanā\n\n  indifferent feeling upekkhā = adukkha-m-asukhā vedanā\n\n\nIII. Perception Group\n\n(saññā-kkhandha)\n\nAll perceptions are divided into 6 classes:  \n\n  \nperception of form, sound, odour, taste, bodily impression, and mental \nimpression.\n  \n\nIV. Group of Mental Formations\n\n(sankhāra-kkhandha)\n\nThis group comprises 50 mental phenomena, of which  \n\n  11 are general psychological elements, \n  25 lofty (sobhana) qualities, \n  14 karmically unwholesome qualities. Cf. Tab. II.\n\nV. Consciousness Group\n\n(viññāna-kkhandha)\n\nThe Suttas divide consciousness, according to the senses, into 6 classes: \n\n  \neye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, mind-consciousness.\n  \n\nThe Abhidhamma and commentaries, however, distinguish, from the karmical or \nmoral viewpoint,  \n\n  \n89 classes of consciousness. Cf. viññāna\nand Tab. 1.\n  \n\nThe moral quality of feeling, perception and consciousness is determined by \nthe mental formations.\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Atthasālini), are: of good \nhealth, blameless, productive of favourable karma-result, skillful. It should be \nnoted that Com. excludes the meaning 'skillful', when the term is applied to \nstates of consciousness.\nIt is defined in M.9 as the 10 wholesome courses of action (s. \nkammapatha). In psychological terms, 'karmically wholesome' are all \nthose karmical volitions (kamma-cetanā) and the consciousness and mental \nfactors associated therewith, which are accompanied by 2 or 3 wholesome roots \n(s. mūla), i.e. by greedlessness (alobha) \nand hatelessness (adosa),\nand in some cases also by non-delusion (amoha: wisdom, \nunderstanding). Such states of consciousness are regarded as 'karmically \nwholesome' as they are causes of favourable karma results and contain the seeds \nof a happy destiny or rebirth. From this explanation, two facts should be noted:\n\n\n\n  \n(1) it is volition that makes a state of consciousness, or an act, 'good' or \n'bad';  \n  \n  \n(2) the moral criterion in Buddhism is the presence or absence of the 3 \nwholesome or moral roots (s. mūla).\n  \n\nThe above explanations refer to mundane (lokiya, q.v.) wholesome \nconsciousness. Supermundane wholesome (lokuttara-kusala) states, i.e. the \nfour paths of sanctity (s. ariyapuggala), \nhave as results only the corresponding four fruitions; they do not constitute \nkarma, nor do they lead to rebirth, and this applies also to the good actions of \nan Arahat (Tab. I, 73-80) and his meditative states (Tab. 1, 81-89), which are \nall karmically inoperative (functional; s. kiriya).\n\nKusala belongs to a threefold division of all consciousness, as found \nin the Abhidhamma (Dhs.), into  \n\n  \nwholesome (kusala), \n  \n  \nunwholesome (akusala) and  \n  \n  \nkarmically neutral (avyākata), \n  \n\nwhich is the first of the triads (tika) in the Abhidhamma schedule \n(mātikā); s.

Und.').\n  \n  \nRight thought (sammā-sankappa): thoughts free \nfrom sensuous desire, from ill-will, and cruelty.\n  \n  \nRight speech (sammā-vācā): abstaining from \nlying, tale-bearing, harsh language, and foolish babble.\n  \n  \nRight bodily action (sammā-kammanta): \nabstaining from killing, stealing, and unlawful sexual intercourse.\n  \n  \nRight livelihood (sammā-ājīva): abstaining \nfrom a livelihood that brings harm to other beings, such as trading in arms, in \nliving beings, intoxicating drinks, poison; slaughtering, fishing, soldiering, \ndeceit, treachery soothsaying, trickery, usury, etc.\n  \n  \nRight effort (sammā-vāyāma): the effort of \navoiding or overcoming evil and unwholesome things, and of developing and \nmaintaining wholesome things (s. padhāna).\n  \n\n  \nRight mindfulness (sammā-sati): mindfulness \nand awareness in contemplating body, feelings, mind, and mind-objects (s. \nsati,\nsatipatthāna).\n  \n  \nRight concentration (sammā-samādhi):\nconcentration of mind associated with wholesome (kusala) consciousness, \nwhich eventually may reach the absorptions (jhāna). \nCf. \nsamādhi.\n  \n\nThere are to be distinguished 2 kinds of concentration, mundane (lokiya) \nand supermundane (lokuttara) concentration. The latter is associated with \nthose states of consciousness known as the 4 supermundane paths and fruitions \n(s. ariya-puggala). As it is said in \nM.117:\n \n\"I tell you, o monks, there are 2 kinds of right view: the understanding that \nit is good to give alms and offerings, that both good and evil actions will bear \nfruit and will be followed by results.... This, o monks, is a view which, though \nstill subject to the cankers, is meritorious, yields worldly fruits, and brings \ngood results. But whatever there is of wisdom, of penetration, of right view \nconjoined with the path - the holy path being pursued, this is called the \nsupermundane right view (lokuttara-sammā-ditthi),\nwhich is not of the world, but which is supermundane and conjoined with the \npath.\"\n \nIn a similar way the remaining links of the path are to be understood.\nAs many of those who have written about the Eightfold Path have misunderstood \nits true nature, it is therefore appropriate to add here a few elucidating \nremarks about it, as this path is fundamental for the understanding and practice \nof the Buddha's teaching.\n \nFirst of all, the figurative expression 'path' should not be interpreted to \nmean that one has to advance step by step in the sequence of the enumeration \nuntil, after successively passing through all the eight stages, one finally may \nreach one's destination, Nibbāna. If this really were the case, one should have \nrealized, first of all, right view and penetration of the truth, even before one \ncould hope to proceed to the next steps, right thought and right speech; and \neach preceding stage would be the indispensable foundation and condition for \neach succeeding stage. In reality, however, the links 3-5 constituting moral \ntraining (sīla), are the first 3 links to be cultivated, then the links \n6-8 constituting mental training (samādhi), and at last right view, etc. \nconstituting wisdom (paññā).\n \n\nIt is, however, true that a really unshakable and safe foundation to the path \nis provided only by right view which, starting from the tiniest germ of faith \nand knowledge, gradually, step by step, develops into penetrating insight \n(vipassanā) and thus forms the immediate condition for the entrance into the \n4 supermundane paths and fruits of holiness, and for the realization of Nibbāna. \nOnly with regard to this highest form of supermundane insight, may we indeed say \nthat all the remaining links of the path are nothing but the outcome and the \naccompaniments of right view.\n \nRegarding the mundane (lokiya) eightfold path, however, its links may \narise without the first link, right view.\n \nHere it must also be emphasized that the links of the path not only do not \narise one after the other, as already indicated, but also that they, at least in \npart, arise simultaneously as inseparably associated mental factors in one and \nthe same state of consciousness. Thus, for instance, under all circumstances at \nleast 4 links are inseparably bound up with any karmically wholesome \nconsciousness, namely 2, 6, 7 and 8, i.e. right thought, right effort, right \nmindfulness and right concentration (M. 117), so that as soon as any one of \nthese links arises, the three others also do so. On the other hand, right view \nis not necessarily present in every wholesome state of consciousness.\n \nMagga is one of the 24 conditions (s. \npaccaya 18).\n    Literature:  \n  \n    The Noble Eightfold Path and its Factors Explained, by Ledi Sayadaw \n\t(WHEEL 245/247). - \n    The Buddha's Ancient Path, by Piyadassi Thera (BPS).- \n    The Noble Eightfold Path, by Bhikkhu Bodhi (WHEEL 308/311).\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

VIII:\n''Recollection of death, developed and frequently practised, yields great \nreward, great blessing, has Deathlessness as its goal and object. But how may \nsuch recollection be developed?\n\"As soon as the day declines, or as the night vanishes and the day is \nbreaking, the monk thus reflects: 'Truly, there are many possibilities for me to \ndie: I may be bitten by a serpent, or be stung by a scorpion or a centipede, and \nthereby I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle for me. Or I may \nstumble and fall to the ground, or the food eaten by me may not agree with my \nhealth; or bile, phlegm and piercing body gases may become disturbing, or men or \nghosts may attack me, and thus I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle \nfor me.' Then the monk has to consider thus: 'Are there still to be found in me \nunsubdued evil, unwholesome things which, if I should die today or tonight, \nmight lead me to suffering?' Now, if he understands that this is the case, he \nshould use his utmost resolution, energy, effort, endeavour, steadfastness, \nattentiveness and clear-mindedness in order to overcome these evil, unwholesome \nthings\" (A VIII, 74).\nIn Vis.M. VIII it is said: 'He who wishes to develop this meditation, should \nretreat to solitude, and whilst living secluded he should thus wisely reflect: \n'Death will come to me! The vital energy will be cut off!' Or: 'Death! Death!' \nTo him, namely, who does not wisely reflect, sorrow may arise by thinking on the \ndeath of a beloved person, just as to a mother whilst thinking on the death of \nher beloved child. Again, by reflecting on the death of a disliked person, joy \nmay arise, just as to enemies whilst thinking on the death of their enemies. \nThrough thinking on the death of an indifferent person, however, no emotion will \narise, just as to a man whose work consists in cremating the dead at the sight \nof a dead body. And by reflecting on one's own death fright may arise ... just \nas at the sight of a murderer with drawn sword one becomes filled with horror. \nThus, whenever seeing here or there slain or other dead beings, one should \nreflect on the death of such deceased persons who once lived in happiness, and \none should rouse one's attentiveness, emotion and knowledge and consider thus: \n'Death will come, etc.' .... Only in him who considers in this way, will the \nhindrances (nīvarana, q.v.) be repressed; and through the idea of death \nattention becomes steadfast, and the exercise reaches \nneighbourhood-concentration (upacāra-samādhi).\"\nAccording to Vis.M. VIII, one may also reflect on death in the following \nvarious ways: one may think of it as a murderer with a drawn sword standing in \nfront of oneself; or one may bear in mind that all happiness ends in death; or \nthat even the mightiest beings on this earth are subject to death; or that we \nmust share this body with all those innumerable worms and other tiny beings \nresiding therein; or that life is something dependent on in-and-out breathing, \nand bound up with it; or that life continues only as long as the elements, food, \nbreath, etc. are properly performing their functions; or that nobody knows when, \nwhere, and under what circumstances, death will take place, and what kind of \nfate we have to expect after death; or, that life is very short and limited. As \nit is said: 'Short, indeed, is this life of men, limited, fleeting, full or woe \nand torment; it is just like a dewdrop that vanishes as soon as the sun rises; \nlike a water-bubble; like a furrow drawn in the water; like a torrent dragging \neverything along and never standing still; like cattle for slaughter that every \nmoment look death in the face\" (A. VII, 74).\n\"The monk devoted to this recollection of death is at all time indefatigable, \ngains the idea of disgust with regard to all forms of existence, gives up \ndelight in life, detests evil, does not hoard up things, is free from stinginess \nwith regard to the necessities of life, the idea of impermanence (anicca) \nbecomes familiar to him; and through pursuing it, the idea of misery (dukkha) \nand of impersonality (anattā) become present to him .... Free from fear \nand bewilderment will he pass away at death; and should he not yet realize the \nDeathless State in his life-time, he will at the dissolution of the body attain \nto a happy course of existence\" (Vis.M. VIII).\n    See Buddhist Reflections on Death, by V. F. Gunaratna (WHEEL 102/103). \n\t-Buddhism and Death, by M.Q.C. Walshe (WHEEL. 260).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Thus, \ngreed (lobha or rāga) comprises all degrees of 'attractedness' \ntowards an object from the faintest trace of a longing thought up to grossest \negoism, whilst hatred (dosa) comprises all degrees of 'repulsion' from \nthe faintest trace of ill-humor up to the highest pitch of hate and wrath.\n \nThe 3 wholesome (kusala) roots, greedlessness, etc., though expressed \nin negative terms, nevertheless possess a distinctly positive character, just as \nis also often the case with negative terms in other languages, for example, the \nnegative term 'immorality', which has a decidedly positive character.\n \nThus, greedlessness (alobha) is a name for unselfishness, liberality, \netc., hatelessness (adosa) for kindness or goodwill (mettā), \nundeludedness (amoha) for wisdom (paññā).\n \n\n\"The perception of impurity is to be developed in order to overcome greed \n(lust); loving-kindness in order to overcome hate; wisdom in order to overcome \ndelusion\" (A.VI.107).\n \n\"Killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, lying, tale-bearing, harsh \nlanguage, frivolous talk, covetousness, ill-will and wrong views (s. \nkammapatha), these things are due either to greed, or hate, or delusion\" \n(A.X.174).\n \n\"Enraptured with lust (greed), enraged with hate, blinded by delusion, \noverwhelmed, with mind ensnared, man aims at his own ruin, at others' ruin, at \nthe ruin of both, and he experiences mental pain and grief. And he follows evil \nways in deeds, words and thought... And he really knows neither his own welfare, \nnor the welfare of others, nor the welfare of both. These things make him blind \nand ignorant, hinder his knowledge, are painful, and do not lead him to peace.\"\n \nThe presence or absence of the 3 unwholesome roots forms part of the mind \ncontemplation in the Satipatthāna Sutta (M.10). They are also used for the \nclassification of unwholesome consciousness (s. Tab. I).\n \n    See The Roots of Good and Evil, by Nyanaponika Thera (WHEEL 251/253).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Cf. Parinibbāna.\n\"Extinction of greed, extinction of hate, extinction of delusion: this is \ncalled Nibbāna\" (S. XXXVIII. 1).\nThe 2 aspects of Nibbāna are:\n\n  \n(1) The full extinction of defilements (kilesa-parinibbāna),\nalso called sa-upādi-sesa-nibbāna (s. It. 41), i.e. 'Nibbāna with the \ngroups of existence still remaining' (s. upādi). \nThis takes place at the attainment of Arahatship, or perfect holiness (s. \nariya-puggala).\n  \n\n  \n(2) The full extinction of the groups of existence (khandha-parinibbāna),\nalso called an-upādi-sesa-nibbāna (s. It. 41, A.IV.118), i.e. 'Nibbāna \nwithout the groups remaining', in other words, the coming to rest, or rather the \n'no-more-continuing' of this physico-mental process of existence. This takes \nplace at the death of the Arahat. - (App.: Nibbāna).\n  \n\nSometimes both aspects take place at one and the same moment, i.e. at the \ndeath of the Arahat; s. sama-sīsī.\n\"This, o monks, truly is the peace, this is the highest, namely the end of \nall formations, the forsaking of every substratum of rebirth, the fading away of \ncraving, detachment, extinction, Nibbāna\" (A. III, 32).\n\"Enraptured with lust (rāga), enraged with anger\n(dosa), blinded by delusion (moha), overwhelmed, with mind \nensnared, man aims at his own ruin, at the ruin of others, at the ruin of both, \nand he experiences mental pain and grief. But if lust, anger and delusion are \ngiven up, man aims neither at his own ruin, nor at the ruin of others, nor at \nthe ruin of both, and he experiences no mental pain and grief. Thus is Nibbāna \nvisible in this life, immediate, inviting, attractive, and comprehensible to the \nwise\" (A.III.55).\n\"Just as a rock of one solid mass remains unshaken by the wind, even so \nneither visible forms, nor sounds, nor odours, nor tastes, nor bodily \nimpressions, neither the desired nor the undesired, can cause such a one to \nwaver. Steadfast is his mind, gained is deliverance\" (A.VI.55).\n\"Verily, there is an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed. If there were \nnot this Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed, escape from the world of the \nborn, the originated, the created, the formed, would not be possible\" \n(Ud.VIII.3).\nOne cannot too often and too emphatically stress the fact that not only for \nthe actual realization of the goal of Nibbāna, but also for a theoretical \nunderstanding of it, it is an indispensable preliminary condition to grasp fully \nthe truth of anattā (q.v.), the egolessness \nand insubstantiality of all forms of existence. Without such an understanding, \none will necessarily misconceive Nibbāna - according to one's either \nmaterialistic or metaphysical leanings - either as annihilation of an ego, or as \nan eternal state of existence into which an ego or self enters or with which it \nmerges. Hence it is said:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;\n      \n      \n        The deed is, but no doer of the deed is there;\n      \n      \n        Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;\n      \n      \n        The path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"\n      \n    \n                            (Vis.M.

They are:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sensuous desire (kāmacchanda),\n          ill-will (vyāpāda),\n          sloth and torpor (thīna-middha),\n          restlessness and scruples (uddhacca-kukkucca), and\n          skeptical doubt (vicikicchā).\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nIn the beautiful similes in A.V.193, sensuous desire is compared with water \nmixed with manifold colours, ill-will with boiling water, sloth and torpor with \nwater covered by moss, restlessness and scruples with agitated water whipped by \nthe wind, skeptical doubt with turbid and muddy water. Just as in such water one \ncannot perceive one's own reflection, so in the presence of these 5 mental \nhindrances, one cannot clearly discern one's own benefit, nor that of others, \nnor that of both.\nRegarding the temporary suspension of the 5 hindrances on entering the first \nabsorption, the stereotype sutta text (e g. A.IX.40) runs as follows:\n\n  \n\"He has cast away sensuous desire; he dwells with a heart free from sensuous \ndesire; from desire he cleanses his heart.\n  \n  \n\"He has cast away ill-will; he dwells with a heart free from ill-will, \ncherishing love and compassion toward all living beings, he cleanses his heart \nfrom ill-will.\n  \n  \n\"He has cast away sloth and torpor; he dwells free from sloth and torpor; \nloving the light, with watchful mind, with clear consciousness, he cleanses his \nmind from sloth and torpor.\n  \n  \n\"He has cast away restlessness and scruples; dwelling with mind undisturbed, \nwith heart full of peace, he cleanses his mind from restlessness and scruples.\n  \n  \n\"He has cast away skeptical doubt; dwelling free from doubt, full of \nconfidence in the good, he cleanses his heart from doubt.\n  \n  \n\"He has put aside these 5 hindrances, and come to know these paralysing \ndefilements of the mind. And far from sensual impressions, far from unwholesome \nthings, he enters into the first absorption, etc.\"\n  \n\nThe overcoming of these 5 hindrances by the absorptions is, as already \npointed out, a merely temporary suspension, called 'overcoming through \nrepression' (vikkhambhana-pahāna). They disappear forever on entering the \n4 supermundane paths (s. ariyapuggala), \ni.e. skeptical doubt on reaching Sotāpanship; sensuous desire, ill-will and \nmental worry on reaching Anāgāmiship; sloth, torpor and restlessness on reaching \nArahantship.\nFor their origination and their overcoming, s. A. I, 2; VI, 21; S. XLVI, 51.\n    See The Five Mental Hindrances, by Nyanaponika Thera (WHEEL 26).\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

In full clarity, it will \nappear in the mind by successful practice of certain concentration-exercises and \nwill then appear as vividly as if seen by the eye. The object perceived at the \nvery beginning of concentration is called the preparatory image \n(parikamma-nimitta). The still unsteady and unclear image, which arises when \nthe mind has reached a weak degree of concentration, is called the acquired \nimage (uggaha-nimitta). An entirely clear and immovable image arising at \na higher degree of concentration is the counter-image\n(patibhāga-nimitta). As soon as this image arises, the stage of \nneighbourhood (or access) concentration (upacāra-samādhi) is reached. For \nfurther details, s. kasina, samādhi.\n\n2. 'Sign of (previous) kamma' (kamma-nimitta) and 'sign of (the \nfuture) destiny' (gati-nimitta); these arise as mental objects of the \nlast karmic consciousness before death (maranāsanna-kamma;\ns. karma, III, 3).\nUsages (1) and (2) are commentarial (s. App.). In sutta usage, the term \noccurs, e.g. as:\n3. 'Outward appearance': of one who has sense-control it is said- that \"he \ndoes not seize upon the general appearance' of an object (na nimittaggāhī; \nM. 38, D. 2; expl. Vis I, 54f; see sīla).\n\n4. 'Object': the six objects, i.e. visual, etc. (rūpa-nimitta;\nS. XXII, 3). Also, when in explanation of animitta-cetovimutti,\nsignless deliverance of mind (s. cetovimutti, vimokkha), it is said, \n'sabba-nimittānam amanasikārā', it refers to the 6 sense-objects (Com. to M. \n43), and has therefore to be rendered \"by paying no attention to any object (or \nobject-ideas).\" - A pleasant or beautiful object (subha-nimitta, q.v.) is \na condition to the arising of the hindrance of sense-desire; a 'repellent \nobject' (patigha-nimitta) for the hindrance of ill-will; contemplation on \nthe impurity of an object (asubha-nimitta; s. asubha) is an \nantidote to sense-desire.\n5. In Pts.M. II, in a repetitive series of terms, nimitta\nappears together with uppādo (origin of existence), pavattam\n(continuity of existence), and may then be rendered by 'condition of existence' \n(s. Path, 194f.).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The absolutely \nnecessary pre-conditions to its attainment are said to be perfect mastery of all \nthe 8 absorptions (jhāna), as well as the previous attainment of Anāgāmī \nor Arahantship (s. ariya-puggala).\nAccording to Vis.M. XXIII, the entering into this state takes place in the \nfollowing way: by means of mental tranquillity (samatha) and insight \n(vipassanā) one has to pass through all the 8 absorptions one after the \nother up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and then one has \nto bring this state to an end. If, namely, according to the Vis.M., the disciple \n(Anāgāmī or Arahat) passes through the absorption merely by means of \ntranquillity, i.e. concentration, he will only attain the sphere of \nneither-perception-nor-non-perception, and then come to a standstill; if, on the \nother hand, he proceeds only with insight, he will reach the fruition (phala)\nof Anāgāmī or Arahantship. He, however, who by means of both faculties has risen \nfrom absorption to absorption and, having made the necessary preparations, \nbrings the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception to an end, such a one \nreaches the state of extinction. Whilst the disciple is passing through the 8 \nabsorptions, he each time emerges from the absorption attained, and regards with \nhis insight all the mental phenomena constituting that special absorption, as \nimpermanent, miserable and impersonal. Then he again enters the next higher \nabsorption, and thus, after each absorption practising insight, he at last \nreaches the state of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and thereafter the \nfull extinction. This state, according to the Com., may last for 7 days or even \nlonger. Immediately at the rising from this state, however, there arises in the \nAnāgāmī the fruition of Anāgāmiship (anāgāmi-phala), in the Arahat the \nfruition of Arahantship (arahatta-phala).\n\nWith regard to the difference existing between the monk abiding in this state \nof extinction on the one hand, and a dead person on the other hand, M 43 says: \n\"In him who is dead, and whose life has come to an end, the bodily (in-and-out \nbreathing), verbal (thought-conception and discursive thinking), and mental \nfunctions (s. sankhāra, 2) have become \nsuspended and come to a standstill, life is exhausted, the vital heat \nextinguished, the faculties are destroyed. Also in the monk who has reached \n'extinction of perception and feeling' (saññā-vedayita-nirodha), the \nbodily, verbal and mental functions have been suspended and come to a \nstandstill, but life is not exhausted, the vital heat not extinguished, and the \nfaculties are not destroyed.\"\nFor details, see Vis.M. XXIII; for texts s. Path 206.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Just as a tree rests on its root, and remains alive only as long \nas its root is not destroyed, similarly all karmically wholesome and unwholesome \nmental states are entirely dependent on the simultaneity and presence of their \nrespective roots, i.e., of greed (lobha), hate\n(dosa), delusion (moha), or greedlessness (alobha),\nhatelessness (adosa), undeludedness (amoha). For the definition of \nthese 6 roots, s. mūla.\n\"The roots are a condition by way of root for the (mental) phenomena \nassociated with a root, and for the corporeal phenomena produced thereby (e.g. \nfor bodily expression)\" (Patth).\n \n(2) Object-condition (ārammana-paccaya) is called something which, as \nobject, forms the condition for consciousness and mental phenomena. Thus, the \nphysical object of sight consisting in colour and light ('light-wave'), is the \nnecessary condition and the sine qua non for the arising of eye-consciousness \n(cakkhu-viññāna), etc.; sound ('sound wave') for ear-consciousness \n(sotā-viññāna), etc.; further, any object arising in the mind is the \ncondition for mind-consciousness (mano-viññāna). The mind-object may be \nanything whatever, corporeal or mental, past, present or future, real or \nimaginary.\n \n(3) Predominance-condition (adhipati-paccaya) is the term for 4 \nthings, on the preponderance and predominance of which are dependent the mental \nphenomena associated with them, namely: concentrated intention (chanda), \nenergy (viriya), consciousness (citta) \nand investigation (vīmamsā). In one and the same state of consciousness, \nhowever, only one of these 4 phenomena can be predominant at a time. \"Whenever \nsuch phenomena as consciousness and mental concomitants are arising by giving \npreponderance to one of these 4 things, then this phenomenon is for the other \nphenomena a condition by way of predominance\" (Patth.). Cf. \niddhi-pāda.\n \n(4-5) Proximity and contiguity (or immediacy)-condition (anantara\nand samanantara-paccaya) - both being identical - refer to any state \nof consciousness and mental phenomena associated with them, which are the \nconditions for the immediately following stage in the process of consciousness. \nFor example, in the visual process, eye-consciousness is for the immediately \nfollowing mind element - performing the function of receiving the visible object \n- a condition by way of contiguity; and so is this mind-element for the next \nfollowing mind-consciousness element, performing the function of investigating \nthe object, etc. Cf. viññāna-kicca.\n \n(6) Co-nascence condition (sahajāta-paccaya), i.e. condition by way of \nsimultaneous arising, is a phenomenon that for another one forms, a condition in \nsuch a way that, simultaneously with its arising, also the other thing must \narise. Thus, for instance, in one and the same moment each of the 4 mental \ngroups (feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness) is for the 3 \nother groups a condition by way of co-nascence or co-arising; or again each of \nthe 4 physical elements (solid, liquid, heat, motion) is such a condition for \nthe other 3 elements. Only at the moment of conception in the mother's womb does \ncorporeality (physical base of mind) serve for the 4 mental groups as a \ncondition by way of co nascence.\n \n(7) Condition by way of mutuality (aññāmañña-paccaya).\nAll the just mentioned associated and co-nascent mental phenomena, as well \nas the 4 physical elements, are, of course, at the same time also conditioned by \nway of mutuality, \"just like three sticks propped up one by another.\" The 4 \nmental groups are one for another a condition by way of mutuality. So also are \nthe 4 elements, and also mentality and corporeality at the moment of conception.\n \n(8) Support-condition (nissaya-paccaya). This condition refers either \nto a pre-nascent (s. 10) or co-nascent (s. 6) phenomenon which is aiding other \nphenomena in the manner of a foundation or base, just as the trees have the \nearth as their foundation, or as the oil-painting rests on the canvas. In this \nway, the 5 sense-organs and the physical base of the mind are for the \ncorresponding 6 kinds of consciousness a prenascent, i.e. previously arisen, \ncondition by way of support. Further all co-nascent (s. 6) phenomena are \nmutually (s. 7) conditioned by each other by way of support.\n \n(9) Decisive-support (or inducement) condition (upanissaya-paccaya) is \nthreefold, namely:\n\n  (a) by way of object (ārammanūpanissaya-paccaya), \n  (b) by way of proximity (anantarūpanissaya), \n  (c) natural decisive support (pakatupanissaya). \n\nThese conditions act as strong inducement or cogent reason.\n\n  (a) Anything past, present or future, corporeal or mental, real or \n  imaginary, may, as object of our thinking, become a decisive support, or \n  strong inducement, to moral, immoral or karmically neutral states of mind. \n  Evil things, by wrong thinking about them, become an inducement to immoral \n  life; by right thinking, an inducement to moral life. But good things may be \n  an inducement not only to similarly good things, but also to bad things, such \n  as self-conceit, vanity, envy, etc.\n  (b;) is identical with proximity condition (No. 4).\n  (c) Faith, virtue, etc., produced in one's own mind, or the influence of \n  climate, food, etc., on one's body and mind, may act as natural and decisive \n  support-conditions. Faith may be a direct and natural inducement to charity, \n  virtue to mental training, etc.; greed to theft, hate to murder; unsuitable \n  food and climate to ill-health; friends to spiritual progress or \n  deterioration.\n\n \n(10) Pre-nascence-condition (purejāta-paccaya) refers to something \n  previously arisen, which forms a base for something arising later on. For \n  example, the 5 physical sense-organs and the physical base of mind, having \n  already arisen at the time of birth, form the condition for the consciousness \n  arising later, and for the mental phenomena associated therewith.\n \n(11) Post-nascence-condition (pacchā-jāta-paccaya) refers to \nconsciousness and the phenomena therewith associated, because they are - just as \nis the feeling of hunger- a necessary condition for the preservation of this \nalready arisen body.\n \n(12) Repetition-condition (āsevana-paccaya) refers to the karmical \nconsciousness, in which each time the preceding impulsive moments \n(javana-citta,\nq.v.) are for all the succeeding ones a condition by way of repetition and \nfrequency, just as in learning by heart, through constant repetition, the later \nrecitation becomes gradually easier and easier.\n \n(13) Karma-condition (kamma-paccaya). The pre-natal karma (i.e \nkarma-volitions, kamma-cetanā, in a previous birth) is the generating \ncondition (cause) of the 5 sense-organs, the fivefold sense-consciousness, and \nthe other karma-produced mental and corporeal phenomena in a later birth. - \nKarmical volition is also a condition by way of karma for the co-nascent mental \nphenomena associated therewith, but these phenomena are in no way karma-results.\n \n(14) Karma-result-condition (vipāka-paccaya). The karma-resultant 5 \nkinds of sense-consciousness are a condition by way of karma-result for the \nco-nascent mental and corporeal phenomena.\n \n(15) Nutriment-condition (āhāra-paccaya). For the 4 nutriments, s. \nāhāra.\n \n(16) Faculty-condition (indriya-paccaya). This condition applies to 20 \nfaculties (indriya), leaving out No. 7 \nand 8 from the 22 faculties. Of these 20 faculties, the 5 physical sense-organs \n(1 - 5), in their capacity as faculties, form a condition only for uncorporeal \nphenomena (eye-consciousness etc.); physical vitality (6) and all the remaining \nfaculties, for the co-nascent mental and corporeal phenomena.\n \n(17) Jhāna-condition (jhāna-paccaya) is a name for the 7 so-called \njhāna-factors, as these form a condition to the co-nascent mental and corporeal \nphenomena, to wit:  \n\n  (1) thought-conception (vitakka), \n  \n  (2) discursive thinking (vicāra), \n  (3) interest (pīti), \n  (4) joy (sukha), \n  (5) sadness (domanassa), \n  (6) indifference (upekkhā), \n  (7) concentration (samādhi). (For \n  definition s. Pāli terms)\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in 4 classes of greedy consciousness (s. \nTab.I. 22-25); 1, 2, 5, 7 in hateful consciousness (Tab.I.30, \n31); 1, 2, 6, 7 in the classes of deluded consciousness (Tab.I.32, \n33).\nThis condition does not only apply to jhāna alone, but also to the \ngeneral intensifying ('absorbing') impact of these 7 factors.\n \n(18) Path-condition (magga-paccaya) refers to the 12 path-factors, as \nthese are for the karmically wholesome and unwholesome mental phenomena \nassociated with them, a way of escape from this or that mental constitution, \nnamely:  \n\n  (1) knowledge (paññā = sammāditthi, right understanding), \n  (2) (right or wrong) thought-conception (vitakka), \n  (3) right speech (sammā-vācā), \n  (4) right bodily action (sammā-kammanta),\n\n  (5) right livelihood (sammā-ājīva), \n  (6) (right or wrong) energy (viriya), \n  (7) (right or wrong) mindfulness (sati), \n  (8) (right or wrong) concentration (samādhi), \n  (9) wrong views (micchāditthi), \n  (10) wrong speech (micchā-vācā), \n  (11) wrong bodily action (micchā-kammanta),\n\n  (12) wrong livelihood (micchā-ājīva). Cf. \nmagga.\n\n \n(19) Association-condition (sampayutta-paccaya) refers to the \n  co-nascent (s. 6) and mutually (s. 7) conditioned 4 mental groups (khandha),\n  \"as they aid each other by their being associated, by having a common physical \n  base, a common object, and by their arising and disappearing simultaneously\" \n  (Patth. Com.).\n \n(20) Dissociation-condition (vippayutta-paccaya)\nrefers to such phenomena as aid other phenomena by not having the same physical \nbase (eye, etc.) and objects. Thus corporeal phenomena are for mental phenomena, \nand conversely, a condition by way of dissociation, whether co-nascent or not.\n \n(21) Presence-condition (atthi-paccaya) refers to a phenomenon - being \npre-nascent or co-nascent - which through its presence is a condition for other \nphenomena. This condition applies to the conditions Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.\n \n(22) Absence-condition (natthi-paccaya) refers to consciousness, etc., \nwhich has just passed, and which thus forms the necessary condition for the \nimmediately following stage of consciousness by giving it an opportunity to \narise. Cf. No. 4.\n \n(23) Disappearance-condition (vigata-paccaya) is identical with No. \n22.\n \n(24) Non-disappearance-condition (avigata-paccaya) is identical with \nNo. 21.\n \nThese 24 conditions should be known thoroughly for a detailed understanding \nof that famous formula of the dependent origination (paticcasamuppāda). \nCf. Fund. III, Guide p. 117 ff. (App.) .\n \n    See The Significance of Dependent Origination, by Nyanatiloka (WHEEL \n\t140).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

LIII), in the \n  sense of 'freedom from samsaric diffuseness'. - Dhp. 254: \"Mankind delights in \n  the diffuseness of the world, the Perfect Ones are free from such diffuseness\" \n  (papañcābhiratā pajā, nippapañca tathāgatā). - \nThe 8th of the 'thoughts of a \n  great man' (mahā-purisa-vitakka; A. VIII, 30) has: \"This Dhamma is for \n  one who delights in non-diffuseness (the unworldly, Nibbāna); it is not for him \n  who delights in worldliness (papañca).\"\n  - \nFor the psychological sense of 'differentiation', see M. 18 (Madhupindika \n  Sutta): \"Whatever man conceives (vitakketi) that he differentiates \n  (papañceti);\n  and what he differentiates, by reason thereof ideas and considerations of \n  differentiation (papañca-saññā-sankhā) arise in him.\" On this text and \n  the term papañca, see Dr. Kurt Schmidt in German Buddhist Writers (WHEEL \n  74/75) p. 61ff. - See D. 21 (Sakka's Quest; WHEEL 10, p.\nIn the commentaries, we often find a threefold classification\n  tanhā-, ditthi-, māna-papañca, which probably means the world's \n  diffuseness created hy craving, false views and conceit. - See M. 123; A. IV, \n173; A.

In that ultimate sense, existence is a mere \nprocess of physical and mental phenomena within which, or beyond which, no real \nego-entity nor any abiding substance can ever be found. Thus, whenever the \nsuttas speak of man, woman or person, or of the rebirth of a being, this must \nnot be taken as being valid in the ultimate sense, but as a mere conventional \nmode of speech (vohāra-vacana).\n\nIt is one of the main characteristics of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, in \ndistinction from most of the Sutta Pitaka, that it does not employ conventional \nlanguage, but deals only with ultimates, or realities in the highest sense \n(paramattha-dhammā). But also in the Sutta Pitaka there are many expositions \nin terms of ultimate language (paramattha-desanā),\nnamely, wherever these texts deal with the groups (khandha), elements \n(dhātu)\nor sense-bases (āyatana), and their components; and wherever the 3 \ncharacteristics (ti-lakkhana) are \napplied. The majority of Sutta texts, however, use the conventional language, as \nappropriate in a practical or ethical context, because it \"would not be right to \nsay that 'the groups' (khandha)\nfeel shame, etc.\"\nIt should be noted, however, that also statements of the Buddha couched in \nconventional language, are called 'truth' (vohāra-sacca),\nbeing correct on their own level, which does not contradict the fact that such \nstatements ultimately refer to impermanent and impersonal processes.\nThe two truths - ultimate and conventional - appear in that form only in the \ncommentaries, but are implied in a sutta-distinction of 'explicit (or direct) \nmeaning' (nītattha, q.v.) and 'implicit meaning (to be inferred)' \n(neyyattha). Further, the Buddha repeatedly mentioned his reservations when \nusing conventional speech, e.g. in D. 9: \"These are merely names, expressions, \nturns of speech, designations in common use in the world, which the Perfect One \n(Tathāgata) uses without misapprehending them.\" See also S. I. 25.\nThe term paramattha, in the sense here used, occurs in the first para. \nof the Kathāvatthu, a work of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (s. Guide, p. 62). (App: \nvohāra).\nThe commentarial discussions on these truths (Com. to D. 9 and M. 5) have not \nyet been translated in full. On these see K N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist \nTheory of Knowledge (London, 1963), pp. 361ff.\nIn Mahāyana, the Mādhyamika school has given a prominent place to the \nteaching of the two truths.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

A long and \nmethodical exposition of the pāramī is given in the concluding \nMiscellaneous Section (pakinnakakathā) of the Com. to Cariyapitaka\nIn Vis.M. IX it is said that through developing the 4 sublime states \n(loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, equanimity; s. \nbrahma-vihāra),\none may reach these 10 perfections, namely:\n\"As the Great Beings (mahā-satta; a synonym often found in the \nMahāyana scriptures for \nBodhisatta, i.e. 'Enlightenment \nBeing or Being destined for Buddha-hood) are concerned about the welfare of \nliving beings, not tolerating the suffering of beings, wishing long duration to \nthe higher states of happiness of beings, and being impartial and just to all \nbeings, therefore: \n\n\tthey give alms (dāna) to all beings so \n\tthat they may be happy, without Investigating whether they are worthy or \n\tnot. \n\tBy avoiding to do them any harm, they observe morality (sīla).  \n\t\n\tIn order to bring morality to perfection, they train themselves in \n\trenunciation (nekkhamma). \n\tIn order to understand clearly what is beneficial and injurious to \n\tbeings, they purify their wisdom (paññā). \n\tFor the sake of the welfare and happiness of others they constantly \n\texert their energy (viriya). \n\tThough having become heroes through utmost energy, they are nevertheless \n\tfull of forbearance (khanti) toward s the manifold failings of beings.  \n\tOnce they have promised to give or do something, they do not break their \n\tpromise ('truthfulness'; sacca). \n\tWith unshakable resolution (adhitthāna) they work for the weal and \n\twelfare of beings.  \n\tWith unshakable kindness (mettā) they are helpful to all.  \n\tBy reason of their equanimity (upekkhā) they do not expect anything in \n\treturn\" (Vis.M. IX.24).\n\nIn the Mahāyana scriptures, where the pāramī occupy a much more \nprominent place, a partly differing list of six is given: \n    \n\t\tliberality, \n\t\tmorality, \n\t\tpatience, \n\t\tenergy, \n\t\tmeditation\n\t\twisdom.\n\n    Literature:  \n  \n\tTen Jātaka Stories (illustrating the 10 pāramī), by I.

      "bodyContent": "\n\n\n  \npaticca-samuppāda\n  \n\n'dependent origination', is the doctrine of the conditionality of all \nphysical and psychical phenomena, a doctrine which, together with that of \nimpersonality (anattā), forms the \nindispensable condition for the real understanding and realization of the \nteaching of the Buddha. It shows the conditionality and dependent nature of that \nuninterrupted flux of manifold physical and psychical phenomena of existence \nconventionally called the ego, or man, or animal, etc.\n \nWhereas the doctrine of impersonality, or anattā,\nproceeds analytically, by splitting existence up into the ultimate constituent \nparts, into mere empty, unsubstantial phenomena or elements, the doctrine of \ndependent origination, on the other hand, proceeds synthetically, by showing \nthat all these phenomena are, in some way or other, conditionally related with \neach other. In fact, the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka, as a whole, treats really of \nnothing but just these two doctrines: phenomenality - implying impersonality and \nconditionality of all existence. The former or analytical method is applied in \nDhammasangani, the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka; the latter or \nsynthetical method, in Patthāna, the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. For a \nsynopsis of these two works, s. Guide I and VII.\n \nThough this subject has been very frequently treated by Western authors, by \nfar most of them have completely misunderstood the true meaning and purpose of \nthe doctrine of dependent origination, and even the 12 terms themselves have \noften been rendered wrongly.\n \nThe formula of dependent origination runs as follows:\n\n      \n        1.

Nāma-rūpa-paccayā salāyatanam: \"Through the mental and \n\t\tphysical phenomena are conditioned the 6 bases,\" i.e. the 5 physical \n\t\tsense-organs, and consciousness as the sixth.\n        5. Salāyatana-paccayā phasso: \"Through the six bases is \n\t\tconditioned the (sensorial mental) impression.\"\n        6.

For a thorough understanding of the paticcasamuppāda\n  he should know the main modes of conditioning, as decisive support, co-nascence, \n  pre-nascence, etc.\nFor a closer study of the subject should be consulted:  \n    \n      Vis.M. XVII; \n      Fund. III; \n      Guide (Ch. VII and Appendix); \n      Dependent Origination, by Piyadassi Thera (WHEEL 15); \n      The Significance of Dependent Origination (WHEEL 140).\n    \n    \n(1.) \"Through ignorance are conditioned the karma-formations\" \n(avijjā-paccayā sankhārā), i.e. all wholesome and unwholesome actions (karma) \nof body, speech and mind, are conditioned through ignorance. By \n'karma-formations' are meant karmically wholesome and unwholesome volitions \n(cetanā), or volitional activities, in short karma (q.v., and Fund. II).\nIn view of the many misconceptions current in the West, it is necessary to \nrepeat here that karma, as a technical term, \nnever signifies anything but moral or immoral action, i.e. the above mentioned \nvolitional activities, or karma-formations, as either causing results in the \npresent life or being the causes of future destiny and rebirth. Thus karma, as a \nphilosophical term, never means the result of action, as often wrongly conceived \nby Western authors.\nNow, in what way are the karma-formations conditioned through ignorance? As \nconcerns the unwholesome karma-formations associated with greed, hate or \ndelusion (lobha, dosa, moha), these are always and in all circumstances, \nconditioned through the simultaneous ignorance inseparably associated therewith. \nThus, ignorance is for the unwholesome karma-formations a condition by way of \nconascence (sahajāta-paccaya), association (sampayutta-paccaya),\npresence (atthi-paccaya), etc. Ignorance further may be for them a \ncondition by way of decisive support or inducement (upanissaya-paccaya), \nif, for instance, ignorance coupled with greed induces a man to commit evil \ndeeds, such as killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, etc. In these \ncases, therefore, ignorance is a 'natural decisive suppport' or 'direct \ninducement' (pakati-upanissaya-paccaya).\nIt also may become an indirect inducement, by way of object \n(ārammanūpanissaya-paccaya)\nof our thinking. This takes place, if, for example, someone remembers a former \nstate of ignorance combined with sensual enjoyment, and in doing so karmically \nunwholesome states spring up, such as sensual desire, grief, etc.\nFor the wholesome (kusala) karma-formations, ignorance can only be a \ncondition by way of decisive support (upanissaya), never by way of \nco-nascence (sahajāta), etc., since wholesome consciousness at that very \nmoment, of course, cannot be associated with any unwholesome phenomenon, such as \nignorance. Ignorance is a 'natural decisive support' or 'direct inducement' \n(pakatupanissaya), for example, if, induced by ignorance and vanity, one \nexerts oneself to attain the absorptions, and thus finally, through \nperseverance, reaches these wholesome states of mind. Ignorance may also be for \nwholesome karma-formations a 'decisive support' or 'inducement by way of object' \n(ārammanūpanissaya), if, for example, one reflects on ignorance as the root \nof all misery in the world, and thus finally attains insight and entrance into \none of the 4 supermundane paths of holiness.\nFor ignorance, s. avijjā; for \nkarma-formations, s. \nsankhāra.\n\n\n(2.) \"Through the karma-formations is conditioned consciousness\" \n  (sankhāra-paccayā viññānam). This proposition teaches that the wholesome and \n  unwholesome karma-formations are the causes of future rebirth in an appropriate \n  sphere (gati). The karma-formations of the previous life condition the \n  budding in a new mother's womb of a fresh psycho-physical aggregation of the 5 \n  groups of existence (s. khandha), which here are represented by \n  consciousness (viññāna). All such karma-resultant (vipāka) \n  consciousness, however, such as eye-consciousness (seeing), etc., as well as all \n  the mental phenomena associated therewith (feeling, etc.), are karmically \n  neutral. It should be understood that already from the very first moment of \n  conception in the mother's womb, this karma resultant consciousness of the \nembryonic being is functioning.\nAgainst Dr. Paul Dahlke's misconception of the paticcasamuppāda\nas \"one single karmical moment of personal experience,\" and of the \n'simultaneity' of all the 12 links of this formula, I should like to state here \ndistinctly that the interpretation of the p. given here as comprising 3 \nsuccessive lives not only agrees with all the different schools of Buddhism and \nall the ancient commentaries, but also is fully identical with the explanations \ngiven already in the canonical suttas. Thus, for example, it is said verbatim in \nNidāna-Samyutta (S. XII, 51): \"Once ignorance (1) and clinging (9) are \nextinguished, neither karmically meritorious, nor demeritorious, nor \nimperturbable karma-formations (2=10) are produced, and thus no consciousness \n(3=11) will spring up again in a new mother's womb.\" And further: \"For, if \nconsciousness were not to appear in the mother's womb, would in that case \nmentality and corporeality (4) arise?\" Cf. above diagram.\nThe purpose of the Buddha in teaching the p. was to show to suffering \nmankind how, depending on ignorance and delusion, this present existence and \nsuffering has come about, and how through extinction of ignorance, and of the \ncraving and clinging conditioned thereby, no more rebirth will follow, and thus \nthe standstill of the process of existence will have been realized and therewith \nthe extinction of all suffering.\n\n(3.) \"Through consciousness are conditioned corporeality and mentality\" \n  (viññāna-paccayā nāma-rūpani). This proposition implies that without \n  consciousness there can be no mental and physical process of existence. By \n  mentality (nāma) is here to be understood the karma-resultant (vipāka) \n  mental phenomena, such as feeling (vedanā),\n  perception (saññā), volition (cetanā: non-karmical volition is \n  here meant), consciousness-impression (phassa), advertence \n  (manasikāra)\n  (M. 9; S. XII, 2). For the basic 7 mental phenomena inseparably associated with \n  every state of consciousness, s. nāma. By \n  corporeality (rūpa) is meant the 4 physical elements (s. \n  dhātu) and the corporeality dependent thereon (s. \nkhandha, I).\nMentality is always conditioned through consciousness; i.e. consciousness \n(viññāna) is for mentality (nāma) a condition by way of conascence \n(sahajāta), mutuality (aññamañña),\nassociation (sampayutta), etc., since the 4 mental groups at all times \nform an inseparable unit.\nConsciousness (viññāna) is for corporeality (rūpa)\na condition by way of co-nascence only at the moment of conception, thereafter a \ncondition by way of post-nascence (pacchājāta-paccaya; \npaccaya 11) and nutriment (āhāra), i.e. \nas a support. Just as the repeatedly arising hunger is a condition and support \nfor the pre-arisen body, so is the consciousness arising afterwards a condition \nand support for the maintenance of this pre-arisen body.\n\n(4.) \"Through mentality and corporeality are conditioned the 6 bases \n  (nāma-rūpa paccayā salāyatanam). The 6 bases are a name for the 5 physical \nsense-organs and, as 6th, the mind-base (manāyatana), i.e. consciousness.\nMentality (nāma; s. 3) is for the 5 physical bases (āyatana),\nor sense-organs, a condition by way of post-nascence. Cf. end of 3.\nMentality (nāma), i.e. feeling. etc., is for the 6th base, or \nconsciousness - as being always inseparably associated therewith a condition by \nway of co-nascence. etc.\nCorporeality (rūpa), here the 4 elements, are for the 5 physical bases \n(āyatana), or sense-organs, a condition by way of support (nissaya).\nCorporeality (rūpa), here the 5 physical sense-organs, are for the 6th \nbase (āyatana), i.e. consciousness, a condition by way of support and \npre-nascence (purejāta-paccaya).\n\n\n(5.) \"Through the 6 bases is conditioned the (sensorial and mental) \n  impression\" (salāyatana-paccayā phasso), for without the 5 physical \n  bases, or sense-organs, there can be no sense-impressions; and without the 6th \nbase, or consciousness, there can be no mental impression.\nThus, the 5 physical bases, eye, etc., are for the corresponding 5 \nsense-impressions (visual impression, etc.) a condition by way of support \n(nissaya) and pre-nascence (purejāta), whereas the 6th, the mind-base \n(consciousness), is for the mental impression a condition by way of co-nascence, \nassociation, mutuality, etc.\n\n(6.) \"Through impression is conditioned feeling\" (phassa-paccayā vedanā), \n  i.e. the sensorial and the mental impressions are for the feeling associated \ntherewith a condition by way of co-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.\n\n(7.) \"Through feeling is conditioned craving\" (vedanā-paccayā tanhā). \n  Any (karma-resultant) feeling, whether agreeable, disagreeable or neutral, \n  bodily or mental, past or expected, may become for craving a condition of \n  decisive support by way of object (ārammanūpanissaya). Even physically \n  and mentally painful feeling may, through the desire to be released there from, \n  become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object \n(ārammanupanissaya).\n\n\n(8.) \"Through craving is conditioned clinging\" (tanhā-paccayā upādānam). \n'Clinging' is explained as an intensified form of craving. It is of 4 kinds:  \n    \n      (1) clinging to sensuality, \n      (2) to erroneous views, \n      (3) to rules and ritual, \n      (4) to personality-belief. \n    \nSensuous craving is to (1) a condition of natural decisive support \n(pakatupanissaya). For (2-4), craving is a condition by way of co-nascence, \nmutuality, root (hetu), etc. It also may be a condition of natural \ndecisive support. For example, through craving for heavenly rebirth, etc. people \noften may be induced to cling to certain rules and rituals, with the hope of \nreaching thereby the object of their desires.\n\n(9.) \"Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming\" \n  (upādāna-paccayā bhavo), i.e. the wholesome and unwholesome active \n  karma-process of becoming (kamma-bhava), as well as the karma-resultant \n  (vipāka) passive process, the so-called 'rebirth-process' \n  (upapatti-bhava). The karma-process (kammabhava) comprises the 5 \n  karmical causes: ignorance, karma-formations, craving, clinging, karma-process \n  (s. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, of the diagram); the rebirth-process (upapatti-bhava)\ncomprises the 5 karma-results (s. 3-7 of the diagram).\nThe karma-process is here, correctly speaking, a collective name for \ngenerative karmic volition (kamma-cetanā) and all the mental phenomena \nassociated therewith, whilst the 2nd link (karma-formations) designates only \nkarmic volition (s. āyūhana). Both, \nhowever, i.e. the 2nd and 10th proposition, practically state one and the same \nthing, namely, that karma is the cause of rebirth, as we shall see under 10.\nClinging (upādāna) may be an inducement of decisive support \n(upanissaya) to many kinds of wholesome and unwholesome karma. Sensuous \nclinging (kāmūpādāna), i.e. clinging to sensuous objects, for example, \nmay be a direct inducement to murder, theft, unlawful intercourse with the other \nsex, evil words and thoughts, etc. Clinging to rules and ritual \n(sīlabbatūpādāna)\nmay lead to self-complacency, fanaticism, cruelty, etc. Clinging is also for the \nevil karma associated therewith, a condition by way of co-nascence, association, \netc.\n\n(10.) \"Through the process of becoming is conditioned rebirth\" \n  (bhava-paccayā jāti), i.e. through the wholesome and unwholesome \n  karma-process (kamma-bhava) is conditioned the rebirth-process \n  (upapatti-bhava). The 2nd and 10th propositions, as already pointed out, \n  practically teach one and the same thing, namely, that karma is the cause of \n  rebirth; in other words, that the karmical volition (cetanā)\n  is the seed out of which springs the new life, just as from the mango-seed is \ngenerated the new mango-tree.\nHence, the 5 karmical causes (ignorance, etc.) of the past birth are the \ncondition for the karma-results of the present birth; and the 5 karmical causes \nof the present birth are the condition for the 5 karma-results of the next birth \n(s. diagram). As it is said in Vis.M. XVII:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \"Five causes were there in the past,\n          \n          \n            Five fruits we find in present life;\n          \n          \n            Five causes do we now produce,\n          \n          \n            Five fruits we reap in future life.\"\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nNow, just as in this process of continually changing mental and bodily \nphenomena, nothing can be found that would pass from one moment to the next \nmoment, so also there is no enduring entity, ego, or personality, within this \nprocess of existence that would transmigrate from one life to the next (s. \nnāma-rūpa, anattā, patisandhi, khandha). \"No being and no living soul passed \nfrom the former life to this life, and yet this present embryo could not have \nentered into existence without the preceding causes\" (Vis.M. XVII). \"Many things \nmay serve to illustrate this fact, as for example the echo, the light of a lamp, \nthe impression of a seal, or the image produced by a mirror\" (ib.).\n\"Whosoever is in the dark with regard to the conditionally arisen things, and \ndoes not understand that karma originates from ignorance, etc., he thinks that \nit must be his ego that knows or does not know, acts and causes to act, and that \narises at rebirth. Or he thinks that the atoms, or a creator, with the help of \nthis embryonic process, must have formed this body, or that it is the ego \nendowed with faculties that has impressions, feels, desires, clings, continues \nand enters again into existence in a new birth. Or he thinks that all beings \nhave been born through fate, or fortuitously\" (Vis.M. XVII).\nNow, on hearing that Buddhism teaches that everything whatever in the world \nis determined by conditions some might come to the conclusion that Buddhism \nteaches some sort of fatalism, and that man has no free will, or that will is \nnot free.\nThe problem 'whether man has a free will' does not exist for, the Buddhist, \nsince he knows that, apart from these ever-changing mental and physical \nphenomena, no such entity as 'man' can be found, and that 'man' is merely a name \nnot relating to any reality. And the question, 'whether will is free', must be \nrejected for the reason that 'will', or volition, is a mental phenomenon \nflashing forth only for a moment, and that as such it had not any existence at \nthe preceding moment. For of a thing which is not, or is not yet, one cannot, \nproperly speaking, ask whether it is free or un-free. The only admissible \nquestion would be whether the arising of 'will' is independent of conditions, or \nwhether it is conditioned. But the same question would equally apply also to all \nthe other mental phenomena, as well as to all physical phenomena, in other \nwords: to everything and every occurrence whatever. And the answer would be: \nwhether will arises, or whether feeling arises, or whether any other mental or \nany physical phenomenon arises, the arising of anything whatsoever is dependent \non conditions, and without conditions nothing ever can arise or enter into \nexistence.\nAccording to Buddhism, everything mental or physical happens in accordance \nwith laws and conditions; and if it were otherwise, chaos and blind chance would \nreign. But such a thing is impossible and contradicts all laws of thinking. Cf. \nFund. III (end).\n\n(11.) \"Through rebirth are conditioned old age and death\" (jātipaccayā \n  jarā-maranam). Without birth there can be no old age and death, no suffering \n  and misery. Thus rebirth is to old age and death, etc. a condition by way of \ndecisive support (upanissaya).\n\nThe Buddha has said (D.15): \"Profound, Ananda. is this dependent origination, \nand profound does it appear. It is through not understanding, not penetrating, \nthis law that this world resembles a tangled ball of thread, a bird's nest, a \nthicket of sedge or reed, and that man does not escape from the lower states of \nexistence, from the course of woe and perdition, suffering from the round of \nrebirth.\" And further (M. 28): 'Whoso understands the dependent origination \nunderstands the Dhamma; and whoso understands the Dhamma understands the \ndependent origination.\"\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

The analytical knowledge of the meaning (attha-p.) is the \n  knowledge with regard to the sense.\n  2. The analytical knowledge of the law (dhamma-p.) is the knowledge \n  with regard to the law.\n  3.

XV).\n\n \n\"(1) attha (Sanskrit artha, √ ar, to \nreach; result, meaning, purpose, true substance) designates, in short, the fruit\n(phala) of a cause (hetu); for since the fruit of a cause results \nfrom adhering to the cause, and is reached and effected thereby, therefore it is \ncalled result (attha). In particular, however, 5 things are considered as\nattha, namely: everything dependent on conditions, Nibbāna, the meaning \nof words, karma-result, and functional consciousness. When anyone reflects on \nthat meaning any knowledge of his, falling within the category concerned with \nmeaning (or result), is the 'analytical knowledge' of meaning.\n\"(2) dhamma (Sanskrit dharma, √ \ndhar, to bear; bearer, condition, law, phenomenon, thing) is, in short, a \nname for condition (paccaya).... In particular, however, 5 things are \nconsidered as dhamma, namely: every cause (hetu) producing a \nresult, the noble path, the spoken word, the karmically wholesome, the \nkarmically unwholesome. When anyone reflects on that law, any knowledge of his, \nfalling within the category concerned with law (or cause), is the 'analytical \nknowledge' of the law.\nIn Vibh. it is further said: 'The knowledge of suffering is the 'analytical \nknowledge' of the true meaning (attha-patisambhidā), the knowledge of its \norigin is the 'analytical knowledge' of the law (dhamma-patisambhidā). \nThe knowledge of the cause is the 'analytical knowledge' of the law \n(dhamma-patisambhidā),\nthe knowledge of the result of the cause is the 'analytical knowledge' of \nthe true meaning (attha-patisambhidā)... That the monk knows the law, the \nsunas etc. this is called the 'analytical knowledge' of the law \n(dhamma-patisambhidā); \nif however, he understands the meaning of this or that speech... it is called \nthe 'analytical knowledge' of the true meaning (attha-patisambhidā).'\n(3) \" 'The knowledge of the language concerning those things' means: the \nlanguage corresponding to reality, and the unfailing mode of expression \nconcerning the true meaning and the law.\n(4) \" 'Knowledge about the kinds of knowledges' is that knowledge which has \nall knowledges as object and considers them. Or, the analytical knowledge of \nready wit (patibhāna-patisambhidā) means the knowledge of the above \nmentioned 3 kinds of knowledge, in all their details, with their objects, \nfunctions, etc.\" (Vis.M. XIV).\nOn the 7 qualities leading to the attainment of the 4 'analytical knowledge' \n, s. A.VII.37 - See Vis.M. XIV, 21ff; Vibh. XV; Pts.M. Patisambhidā Kathā.\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For just as the resounding of the echo is conditioned by a \nsound, etc., and nowhere a transmigration of sound has taken place, just so it \nis with this consciousness. Further it is said: 'In this continuous process, no \nsameness and no otherness can be found.' For if there were full identity \n(between the different stages), then also milk never could turn into curd. And \nif there were a complete otherness, then curd could never come from milk.... If \nin a continuity of existence any karma-result takes place, then this \nkarma-result neither belongs to any other being, nor does it come from any other \n(kamma), because absolute sameness and otherness are excluded here\" (Vis, XVII \n164ff).\nIn Mil. it is said:\n\n  \n\"Now, Venerable Nāgasena, the one who is reborn, is he the same as the one \nwho has died, or is he another?\"\n  \n  \n\"Neither the same, nor another\" (na ca so na ca añño).\n  \n\n  \n\"Give me an example.\"\n  \n  \n\"What do you think, o King: are you now, as a grown-up person, the same that \nyou had been as a little, young and tender babe? \"\n  \n  \n\"No, Venerable Sir.

The light during the whole night depends on one and the \nsame lamp.''\n  \n  \n\"Just so, o King, is the chain of phenomena linked together. One phenomenon \narises, another vanishes, yet all are linked together, one after the other, \nwithout interruption. In this way one reaches the final state of consciousnes \nneither as the same person. nor as another person.''\n  \n\nAccording to the nature of their rebirth consciousness, beings divide into \nthe following 3 groups:\n1. ahetu-patisandhika: a 'being reborn without root-conditions', is a \nbeing whose consciousness at the moment of rebirth was not accompanied by any of \nthe 3 noble root-conditions, viz. greedlessness, hatelessness, undeludedness (s. \nmūla), i.e. selflessness, kindness, intelligence. Such beings are found \nin the 4 lower worlds (apāya), in which \ncase the function of rebirth is exercised by the class of consciousness listed \nin Tab. I as No. 56. But if such beings are born in \nthe sensuous sphere as humans, they will be crippled, blind, deaf, mentally \ndeficient, etc. (Rebirth-consciousness = Tab. I, No. \n41)\n2. dvihetu (or duhetu)-patisandhika: a 'being reborn with only \n2 (noble) root-conditions', i.e. greedlessness and hatelessness. \n(Rebirth-consciousness = Tab. I, Nos. 44, 45, 48 or \n49.)\n3. tihetu-patisandhika: a 'being reborn with 3 (noble) \nroot-conditions'. Such a being can be found only among men. \n(Rebirth-consciousness = Tab. I, Nos. 42, 43, 46, or \n47) and higher heavenly beings.\n    On these 3 types of rebirth, See Atthasālini Tr. 11, 354 - 379. (App.: \n\tpatisandhika).\nIn the suttas, the terms for rebirth are chiefly \n\n  \n punabbhava\n(q.v.), 'renewed existence', and \n  \n  \n abhinibbatti 'arising';  \n  \n  \nor both combined as punabbhavābhinibbatti. - (App.: patisandhi).\n  \n\n  \n  Literature  \n  \n    Vis.M.

In lists of both these \ncategories it is generally mentioned first (e.g. Dhs.1: M.9), due to its \nfundamental position in the cognitive process In M.18 it is thus defined: \n\"Dependent on the eye and the forms, eye-consciousness arises; the \ncoming-together of the three is sense-impression\" (similarly stated in the case \nof the other 5 senses, including mind). In the dependent origination, it is \nconditioned by the six sense-bases and is a conditioning factor of feeling (s. \npaticca-samuppāda\n5, 6). Its relation to mind-and-body (nāma-rūpa) is described in \nD.15, and its influence on feeling and wrong views, in D.1 (at the end). - It is \none of the 4 nutriments (āhāra, q.v.), and the first factor in the pentad \nof sense-impression (phassa-pañcamaka), together with feeling, \nperception, volition and consciousness (see Abh. St., p. 47ff ).\nBeing a key function in the mind's contact with the world of objects and \nbeing a potential source of defilements, sense-impression is an important \nsubject for reflective insight contemplation as succinctly formulated in many \nverses of the Sn.: 736/7, 778, 851, 870/72, 923.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

There it is shown how this development takes place \ngradually, and in conformity with laws, from the very first hearing of the \ndoctrine, and from germinating faith and dim comprehension, up to the final \nrealization of deliverance.\n\"After hearing the law, he is filled with confidence, and he thinks: 'Full of \nhindrances is household life, a refuse heap; but the homeless life (of a monk) \nis like the open air. Not easy is it, when one lives at home, to fulfill in all \npoints the rules of the holy life. How if now I were to cut off hair and beard, \nput on the yellow robe, and go forth from home to the homeless life?' And after \na short time, having given up his possessions, great or little, having forsaken \na circle of relations, small or large, he cuts off hair and beard, puts on the \nyellow robe, and goes forth from home to the homeless life.\nHaving thus left the world, he fulfills the rules of the monks. He avoids the \nkilling of living beings and abstains from it; without stick or sword, \nconscientious, full of sympathy, he is desirous of the welfare of all living \nbeings. He avoids stealing ... avoids unchastity ... avoids lying ... \ntale-bearing ... harsh language ... vain talk.\n\"He abstains from destroying vegetal germs and plants; eats only at one time \nof the day; keeps aloof from dance, song, music and the visiting of shows; \nrejects floral adornment, perfumes, ointment, as well as any other kind of \nadornment and embellishment. High and gorgeous beds he does not use. Gold and \nsilver he does not accept ... keeps aloof from buying and selling things ....\n\"He contents himself with the robe that protects his body, and with the \nalms-bowl with which he keeps himself alive. Wherever he goes, he is provided \nwith these two things, just as a winged bird in flying carries its wings along \nwith him.\n\"By fulfilling this noble domain of morality (sīla) he feels in his \nheart an irreproachable happiness.\"\nIn what follows thereafter it is shown how the disciple watches over his 5 \nsenses and his mind, and by this noble restraint of the senses \n(indriya-samvara) feels in his heart an unblemished happiness; how in all \nhis actions he is ever mindful and clearly conscious; and how, being equipped \nwith this lofty morality (sīla), and with this noble restraint of the \nsenses (indriya-samvara), and with mindfulness and clear consciousness \n(sati-sampajañña), he choses a secluded dwelling, and freeing his mind from \nthe 5 hindrances (nīvarana, q.v.) he reaches full concentration \n(samādhi, q.v.); and how thereafter, by developing insight\n(vipassanā q.v.) with regard to the impermanency (anicca), misery\n(dukkha) and impersonality (anattā, q.v.) of all phenomena of \nexistence, he finally realizes deliverance from all cankers and defilements, and \nthus the assurance arises in him:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \"For ever am I liberated,\n          \n          \n        This is the last time I am born,\n          \n          \n        No new existence waits for me.\"\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nCf.

On the 'two truths', conventional and ultimate, see \nparamattha.\n2. 'The Four Noble Truths' (ariya-sacca) are the briefest synthesis of \nthe entire teachings of Buddhism, since all those manifold doctrines of the \nthreefold canon are, without any exception, included therein. \nThey are: \n\n  the truth of suffering,  \n  of the origin of suffering,  \n  of the extinction of suffering,  \n  and of the Eightfold Path leading to the extinction of suffering.  \n\n \n\n  \nThe 1st truth, briefly stated, teaches that all forms of existence whatsoever \nare unsatisfactory and subject to suffering (dukkha).\n  \n\n  \nThe 2nd truth teaches that all suffering, and all rebirth, is produced by \ncraving (tanhā).\n  \n\n  \nThe 3rd truth teaches that extinction of craving necessarily results in \nextinction (nirodha) of rebirth and suffering, i.e. \nnibbāna.\n  \n  \nThe 4th truth of the Eightfold Path (magga) indicates the means by \nwhich this extinction is attained.\n  \n\nThe stereotype text frequently recurring in the Sutta Pitaka, runs as \nfollows:\n\n  \n\"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, \ndecay is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and \ndespair are suffering; in short, the 5 groups of existence connected with \nclinging are suffering (cf. dukkha, dukkhata).\n  \n\n  \n''But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is \nthat craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and, bound up with lust and \ngreed, now here, now there, finds ever fresh delight. It is the sensual craving \n(kāma-tanhā), the craving for existence (bhava-tanhā),\nthe craving for non-existence or self-annihilation (vibhava-tanhā).\n  \n\n  \n\"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the extinction of suffering? It is \nthe complete fading away and extinction of this craving, its forsaking and \ngiving up, liberation and detachment from it.\n  \n  \n\"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the path leading to the extinction \nof suffering? It is the Noble Eightfold Path (ariya-atthangika-magga)\nthat leads to the extinction of suffering, namely:\n  \n\n \n\n  \n    \n      1. Right view (sammā-ditthi)\n      \n      2. Right thought (sammā-sankappa)\n    \n      III. Wisdom (paññā)\n  \n  \n    \n      3. Right speech (sammā-vācā)\n      \n      4. Right action (sammā-kammanta)\n      \n      5. Right livelihood (sammd-djiva)\n    \n       \n      I. Morality (sīla)\n  \n  \n    \n      6. Right effort (sammā-vāyāma)\n      \n      7. Right mindfulness (sammā-sati)\n      \n      8. Right concentration (sammā-samādhi)\n    \n       \n      II. Concentration (samādhi)\n  \n\n \n1. \"What now, o monks, is right view (or right understanding)? It is the \nunderstanding of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the extinction of \nsuffering, and of the path leading to the extinction of suffering.\n2. \"What now, o monks, is right thought? It is a mind free from sensual lust, \nill-will and cruelty.\n3. \"What now, o monks, is right speech? Abstaining from lying, tale-bearing, \nharsh words, and foolish babble (cf. tiracchānakathā).\n\n4. \"What now, o monks, is right action? Abstaining from injuring living \nbeings, from stealing and from unlawful sexual intercourse (s. \nkāmesu micchācāra).\n5. \"What now, o monks, is right livelihood? If the noble disciple rejects a \nwrong living, and gains his living by means of right livelihood (s.  \nmagga, 5).\n6. \"What now, o monks, is right effort? If the disciple rouses his will to \navoid the arising of evil, demeritorious things that have not yet arisen; ... if \nhe rouses his will to overcome the evil, demeritorious things that have already \narisen; ... if he rouses his will to produce meritorious things that have not \nyet arisen; ... if he rouses his will to maintain the meritorious things that \nhave already arisen and not to let them disappear, but to bring them to growth, \nto maturity and to the full perfection of development; he thus makes effort, \nstirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives (s. \npadhāna).\n\n7. \"What now, o monks is right mindfulness? If the disciple dwells in \ncontemplation of corporeality ... of feeling ... of mind ... of the \nmind-objects, ardent, clearly conscious, and mindful after putting away worldly \ngreed and grief (s. satipatthāna).\n\n8. \"What now, o monks, is right concentration? If the disciple is detached \nfrom sensual objects, detached from unwholesome things, and enters into the \nfirst absorption ... the second absorption ... the third absorption ... the \nfourth absorption\" (s. jhāna).\n\nIn the Buddha's first sermon, the \nDhammacakkappavattana \nSutta, it is said that \n\n  \nthe first truth (suffering) is to be fully understood; \n  \n  \nthe second truth (craving) to be abandoned; \n  \n  \nthe third truth (Nibbāna) to be realized; \n  \n  \nthe fourth truth (the path) to be cultivated.\n  \n\n\"The truth of suffering is to be compared with a disease, the truth of the \norigin of suffering with the cause of the disease, the truth of extinction of \nsuffering with the cure of the disease, the truth of the path with the medicine\" \n(Vis.M. XVI).\nIn the ultimate sense, all these 4 truths are to be considered as empty of a \nself, since there is no feeling agent, no doer, no liberated one. no one who \nfollows along the path. Therefore it is said:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            'Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found.\n          \n          \n            The deed is, but no doer of the deed is there.\n          \n          \n            Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it.\n          \n          \n            The path is, but no traveller on it is seen.\n          \n        \n         \n        \n          \n            'The first truth and the second truth are empty\n          \n          \n            Of permanency, joy, of self and beauty;\n          \n          \n            The Deathless Realm is empty of an ego,\n          \n          \n            And free from permanency, joy and self, the path.'\n          \n        \n                            (Vis.M. XVI)\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          \n                             \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nIt must be pointed out that the first truth does not merely refer to actual \nsuffering, i.e. to suffering as feeling, but that it shows that, in consequence \nof the universal law of impermanency, all the phenomena of existence whatsoever, \neven the sublimest states of existence, are subject to change and dissolution, \nand hence are miserable and unsatisfactory; and that thus, without exception, \nthey all contain in themselves the germ of suffering.

His faith, however, should \nbe \"reasoned and rooted in understanding\" (ākāravatā saddhā dassanamūlika; \nM. 47), and he is asked to investigate and test the object of his faith (M. 47, \n95). A Buddhist's faith is not in conflict with the spirit of inquiry, and \n\"doubt about dubitable things\" (A. II, 65; S. XLII, 13) is admitted and inquiry \ninto them is encouraged. The 'faculty of faith' (saddhindriya)\nshould be balanced with that of wisdom (paññindriya; s. \nindriya-samatta).\nIt is said: \"A monk who has understanding, establishes his faith in accordance \nwith that understanding\" (S. XLVIII, 45). Through wisdom and understanding, \nfaith becomes an inner certainty and firm conviction based on one's own \nexperience.\nFaith is called the seed (Sn. v. 77) of all wholesome states because, \naccording to commentarial explanations, it inspires the mind with confidence \n(okappana, pasāda) and determination (adhimokkha), for 'launching \nout' (pakkhandhana; s.

Tab. II). It is one of the 4 streams of \nmerit (puññadhārā, q.v.), one of the 5 spiritual faculties (indriya, \nq.v.), spiritual powers (bala, q.v.), elements of exertion \n(padhāniyanga, q.v.) and one of the 7 treasures (dhana, q.v.).\n    See Faith in the Buddha's Teaching, by Soma Thera (WHEEL 262). \"Does \n\tSaddhā mean Faith?'' by Ñānamoli Thera (in WHEEL 52/53).\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Cf. \nnāma, \ncetanā.\n\n \nRight concentration (sammā-samādhi), as the last link of the 8-fold \n  Path (s. magga), is defined as the 4 \n  meditative absorptions (jhāna). In a \n  wider sense, comprising also much weaker states of concentration, it is \n  associated with all karmically wholesome (kusala)\n  consciousness. Wrong concentration (micchā-samādhi) is concentration \n  associated with all karmically unwholesome (akusala) \n  consciousness. Wherever in the texts this term is not differentiated by 'right' \n  or 'wrong', there 'right' concentration is meant .\n \nIn concentration one distinguishes 3 grades of intensity:\n\n  \n(1) 'Preparatory concentration' (parikamma-samādhi)\nexisting at the beginning of the mental exercise.\n  \n  \n(2) 'Neighbourhood concentration' (upacāra-samādhi),\ni.e. concentration 'approaching' but not yet attaining the 1st absorption (jhāna), \nwhich in certain mental exercises is marked by the appearance of the so-called \n'counter-image' (patibhāga-nimitta).\n  \n\n  \n(3) 'Attainment concentration' (appanā-samādhi),\ni.e. that concentration which is present during the absorptions. (App.)\n  \n\nFurther details, s. bhāvana, Vis.M. \nIII and Fund. IV.\n \nConcentration connected with the 4 noble path-moments (magga),\n  and fruition-moments (phala), is called supermundane (lokuttara), \n  having Nibbāna as object. Any other concentration, even that of the sublimest \n  absorptions is merely mundane (lokiya).\n \nAccording to D.33, the development of concentration (samādhi-bhāvanā)\nmay procure a 4-fold blessing:  \n\n  \n(1) present happiness through the 4 absorptions;  \n  \n  \n(2) knowledge and vision (ñāna-dassana) - here probably identical with \nthe 'divine eye' (s. abhiññā) through \nperception of light (kasina); \n  \n  \n(3) mindfulness and clear comprehension through the clear knowledge of the \narising, persisting and vanishing of feelings, perceptions and thoughts;  \n  \n  \n(4) extinction of all cankers (āsavakkhaya) through understanding the \narising and passing away of the 5 groups forming the objects of clinging (s. \nkhandha).\n  \n\nConcentration is one of the 7 factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga), \none of the 5 spiritual faculties and powers (s. \nbala), and the last link of the 8-fold Path.  \nIn the 3-fold division of the 8-fold Path (morality, concentration and \nwisdom), it is a collective name for the three last links of the path (s. \nsikkhā).\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Though as a distinct way of practice \n(s. samatha-yānika), it aims at the attainment of the meditative \nabsorptions (jhāna, q.v.), a high degree of tranquil concentration \n(though not necessarily that of the absorptions) is indispensable for insight \ntoo. Tranquillity frees the mind from impurities and inner obstacles, and gives \nit greater penetrative strength.\n''What now is the power of tranquillity (samatha-bala)? It is the \none-pointedness and non-distraction of the mind due to freedom from desire \n(renunciation) ... to freedom from ill-will ... to the perception of light (s. \naloka-saññā) ... to non-distraction ... to the defilling of phenomena ... to \nknowledge, gladness, the 8 attainments, the 10 kasinas, the 10 recollections, \nthe 9 cemetery contemplations, the 32 kinds of respiration-mindfulness ... the \none-pointedness and non-distraction of the mind of one contemplating abandonment \n(relinquishment) while inhaling and exhaling (s. ānāpānasati).\n\"The power of tranquillity consists of the freedom from perturbation; in the \n1st absorption, from the 5 hindrances (nīvarana,\n(q.v.); in the 2nd absorption, from thought-conception and discursive thinking; \n... in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception it consists of the \nfreedom from perturbation by the perception of the sphere of nothingness (s.\nanupubbanirodha), which is no longer agitated and irritated by defilements \nassociated with restlessness, nor by the groups of existence\" (Pts.M. 1. p. 97)\n(2) 'Insight' (s. vipassanā) is the penetrative understanding by \ndirect meditative experience of the impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and \nimpersonality of all material and mental phenomena of existence. It is insight \nthat leads to entrance into the supermundance states of holiness and to final \nliberation.\n''What now is the power of insight? It is the contemplation of impermanency \n(aniccānupassanā), of misery (dukkhanupassanā),\nimpersonality' (anattānupassanā), of aversion (nibbidanupassanā),\ndetachment (virāganupassanā), extinction (nirodha), ahandonment \n(patinissagga),\nwith regard to corporcality, feeling, perception, mental formations and \nconsciousness.... That in contemplating the impermanency one is no more agitated \nby the idea of grasping ... no more by ignorance and the defilements associated \ntherewith and no more by the groups of existence: this is called the power of \ninsight\" (Pts.M. p. 97).\n\"Two things are conducive to knowledge: tranquillity and insight. If \ntranquillity is developed, what profit does it bring? The mind is developed. If \nthe mind is developed, what profit does it bring? All lust is abandoned.\n\"If insight is developed, what profit does it bring? Wisdom is developed. If \nwisdom is developed, what profit does it bring? All ignorance is abandoned\" (A. \nII, 2.7).\nThere is a method of meditative practice where, in alternating sequence, \ntranquillity-meditation and insight-meditation are developed. It is called \n'tranquillity and insight joined in pairs' (samatha-vipassanāyuganaddha),\nthe coupling or yoking of tranquillity and insight. He who undertakes it, first \nenters into the 1st absorption. After rising from it, he contemplates the mental \nphenomena that were present in it (feeling, perception, etc.) as impermanent, \npainful and not-self, and thus he develops insight. Thereupon he enters into the \n2nd absorption; and after rising from it, he again considers its constituent \nphenomena as impermanent, etc. In this way, he passes from one absorption to the \nnext, until at last, during a moment of insight, the intuitive knowledge of the \npath (of Stream-entry, etc.) flashes forth - See A. IV, 170; A.IX, 36; Pts: \nYuganaddha Kathā.\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "bodyContent": "\n\n\n  \nsankhāra\n  \n\n This term has, according to its context, different shades of meaning, \nwhich should be carefully distinguished.\n(I) To its most frequent usages (s. foll. 1-4) the general term 'formation' \nmay be applied, with the qualifications required by the context. This term may \nrefer either to the act of 'forming or to the passive state of 'having been \nformed' or to both.\n1. As the 2nd link of the formula of dependent origination, (paticcasamuppāda), \nsankhāra has the active aspect, \n'forming, and signifies \nkarma, i.e. wholesome or unwholesome volitional \nactivity (cetanā) of body (kāya-sankhāra), \nspeech (vacī-sankhāra) or mind \n(citta- or mano-sankhāra).\nThis definition occurs, e.g. at S.XII.2, 27. For sankhāra \nin this sense, the word 'karma-formation' has been coined by the author. In \nother passages, in the same context,  sankhāra \nis defined by reference to  \n\n  (a) meritorious karma-formations (puññ'ābhisankhāra), \n  (b) demeritorious k. (apuññ'abhisankhāra), \n  (c) imperturbable k. (āneñj'ābhisankhāra), e.g. in S.XII.51; D.33. \n  \n\nThis threefold division covers karmic activity in all spheres of existence: \nthe meritorious karma-formations extend to the sensuous and the fine-material \nsphere, the demeritorious ones only to the sensuous sphere, and the \n'imperturbable' only to the immaterial sphere.\n2. The aforementioned three terms, kāya-, vacī- and citta-sankhāra\nare sometimes used in quite a different sense, namely as  \n\n  (1) bodily function, i.e. in-and-out-breathing (e.g. M.10), \n  (2) verbal function, i.e. thought-conception and discursive thinking, \n  (3) mental-function, i.e. feeling and perception (e.g. M.44). See \n  nirodhasamāpatti.\n\n\n3. It also denotes the 4th group of existence (sankhārakkhandha),\nand includes all 'mental formations' whether they belong to 'karmically forming' \nconsciousness or not. See khandha,\nTab.II. and S.XXII.56, 79.\n4. It occurs further in the sense of anything formed (sankhata) \nand conditioned, and includes all things whatever in the world, all phenomena of \nexistence. This meaning applies, e.g. to the well-known passage, \"All formations \nare impermanent... subject to suffering\" (sabbe sankhāra aniccā ... dukkhā). \nIn that context, however, s. is subordinate to the still wider and \nall-embracing term dhamma (thing); for\ndhamma includes also the Unformed or Unconditioned Element \n(asankhata-dhātu),\ni.e. Nibbāna (e.g. in sabbe dhammā anattā, \"all things are without a \nself\").\n(II) Sankhāra also means sometimes 'volitional effort', e.g. in the \nformula of the roads to power (iddhi-pāda); \nin sasankhāra- and asankhāra-parinibbāyī (s. \nanāgāmī); and in the Abhidhamma terms \nasankhārika- and \nsasankhārika-citta,\ni.e. without effort = spontaneously, and with effort = prompted.\nIn Western literature, in English as well as in German, sankhāra\nis sometimes mistranslated by 'subconscious tendencies' or similarly (e.g Prof \nBeckh: \"unterbewußte Bildekräfte,\" i.e. subconscious formative forces). This \nmisinterpretation derives perhaps from a similar usage in non-Buddhist Sanskrit \nliterature, and is entirely inapplicable to the connotations of the term in Pāli \nBuddhism, as listed above under I, 1-4. For instance, within the dependent \norigination, s. is neither subconscious nor a mere tendency, but is a fully \nconscious and active karmic volition. In the context of the 5 groups of \nexistence (s. above I, 3), a very few of the factors from the group of mental \nformations (sankhārakkhandha) are also present as concomitants of \nsubconsciousness (s. Tab.I,\nTab.II, Tab.III), but are of course not restricted \nto it, nor are they mere tendencies.\n  \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Thereby the \nSatipathāna Sutta forms an illustration of the way in which these 4 \ncontemplations relating to the 5 groups of existence (khandha) \nsimultaneously come to be realized, and finally lead to insight into the \nimpersonality of all existence.\n(1) The contemplation of the body (kāyanupassanā)\nconsists of the following exercises:  \n\n  mindfulness with regard to in-and-outbreathing\n(ānāpānasati), \n  minding the 4 postures (iriyāpatha), \n  \n  mindfulness and clarity of consciousness (satisampajañña, q.v.), \n  \n  reflection on the 32 parts of the body (s. \nkāyagatāsati and \nasubha), \n  analysis of the 4 physical elements (dhātuvavatthāna), \n  \n  cemetery meditations (sīvathikā).\n\n(2) All feelings (vedanānupassanā) that arise in the meditator he \nclearly perceives, namely: \n\n  agreeable and disagreeable feeling of body and mind, \n  sensual and super-sensual feeling, \n  indifferent feeling .\n\n(3) He further clearly perceives and understands any state of consciousness \nor mind (cittānupassanā), whether it is  \n\n  greedy or not, \n  hateful or not, \n  deluded or not, \n  cramped or distracted, \n  developed or undeveloped, \n  surpassable or unsurpassable,\n  concentrated or unconcentrated, \n  liberated or unliberated.\n\n(4) Concerning the mind-objects (dhammānupassanā), \n\n  he knows whether one of the five hindrances (nīvarana) \n  is present in him or not, knows how it arises, how it is overcome, and how in \n  future it does no more arise. \n  He knows the nature of each of the five groups (khandha), \n  how they arise, and how they are dissolved. \n  He knows the 12 bases of all mental activity (āyatana): \n  the eye and the visual object, the ear and the audible object, .. mind and \n  mind-object, \n  he knows the fetters (samyojana) based \n  on them, knows how they arise, how they are overcome, and how in future they \n  do no more arise. \n  He knows whether one of the seven factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga, \n  q.v.) is present in him or not, knows how it arises, and how it comes to full \n  development. \n  Each of the Four Noble Truths (sacca) he \n  understands according to reality.\n\n \nThe 4 contemplations comprise several exercises, but the Satipatthāna should \nnot therefore be thought of as a mere collection of meditation subjects, any one \nof which may be taken out and practised alone. Though most of the exercises \nappear also elsewhere in the Buddhist scriptures, in the context of this sutta \nthey are chiefly intended for the cultivation of mindfulness and insight, as \nindicated by the repetitive passage concluding each section of the sutta (see \nbelow).  \nThe 4 contemplations cover all the 5 groups of existence (khandha), \nbecause mindfulness is meant to encompass the whole personality. Hence, for the \nfull development of mindfulness, the practice should extend to all 4 types of \ncontemplation, though not every single exercise mentioned under these four \nheadings need be taken up. A methodical practice of Satipatthāna has to start \nwith one of the exercises out of the group 'contemplation of the body', which \nwill serve as the primary and regular subject of meditation: The other exercises \nof the group and the other contemplations are to be cultivated when occasion for \nthem arises during meditation and in everyday life.\nAfter each contemplation it is shown how it finally leads to \ninsight-knowledge: \"Thus with regard to his own body he contemplates the body, \nwith regard to the bodies of others he contemplates the body, with regard to \nboth he contemplates the body. He beholds how the body arises and how it passes \naway, beholds the arising and passing away of the body. 'A body is there' (but \nno living being, no individual, no woman, no man, no self, nothing that belongs \nto a self; neither a person, nor anything belonging to a person; Com.): thus he \nhas established his attentiveness as far as it serves his knowledge and \nmindfulness, and he lives independent, unattached to anything in the world.''\nIn the same way he contemplates feeling, mind and mind-objects.\nIn M.118 it is shown how these four foundations of mindfulness may be brought \nabout by the exercise of mindfulness on in-and-out breathing (ānāpāna-sati).\n    Literature: \n  \n    The Way of Mindfulness, tr. of Sutta and Com., by Soma Thera (3rd ed; \n\tKandy 1967, BPS). - \n    The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, by Nyanaponika Thera (3rd ed.; London. \n\tRider & Co.). \n    The Foundations of Mindfulness (tr. of M. 10), Nyanasatta Thera (Wheel \n\t19). \n    \n    The Satipatthāna Sutta and its Application to Modern Life, V.

It is the \nwholesome bodily action (kāya-kamma, s. \nkarma), wholesome verbal action (vacī-kamma, \ns. karma), and also the purity with regard to \nlivelihood which I call morality\" (M. 78).

V, 87,109 \n,114, etc. ) .\n(2) Restraint of the senses (indriya-samvara-sīla).\n\"Whenever the monk perceives a form with the eye, a sound with the ear, an odour \nwith the nose, a taste with the tongue, an impression with the body, an object \nwith the mind, he neither adheres to the appearance as a whole, nor to its \nparts. And he strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome \nthings, greed and sorrow, would arise, if he remained with unguarded senses; and \nhe watches over his senses, restrains his senses\" (M 38).\n(3) Purification of livelihood (ājīva-pārisuddhi-sīla).\nIt consists therein that the monk does not acquire his livelihood in a way \nunbefitting to a monk.\n(4) Morality with regard to the 4 requisites (paccaya-sannissita-sīla).\nIt consists therein that the monk is guided by the right mental attitude when \nmaking use of the 4 requisites: robes, alms food, dwelling and medicine. \"Wisely \nreflecting he makes use of his robes ... merely to protect himself against cold \nand heat, etc. Wisely reflecting he makes use of his alms food... merely as a \nprop and support to this body.... Wisely reflecting he makes use of his \ndwelling... merely to keep off the dangers of weather and to enjoy solitude.... \nWisely reflecting he makes use of the necessary medicines, merely to suppress \nfeelings of sickness that arise, and to reach perfect freedom from suffering\" \n(cf.

XXII, 85, 86) that, in the highest sense \n(paramattha, q.v.) the Tathāgata cannot, even at lifetime, be discovered, \nhow much less after death, and that neither the 5 groups of existence \n(khandha, q.v.) are to be regarded as the Tathāgata, nor can the Tathāgata \nbe found outside these corporeal and mental phenomena. The meaning intended here \nis that there exist only these ever-changing corporeal and mental phenomena, \narising and vanishing from moment to moment, but no separate entity, no \npersonality.\nWhen the commentaries in this connection explain Tathāgata by 'living being' \n(satta), they mean to say that here the questioners are using the merely \nconventional expression, Tathāgata, in the sense of a really existing entity.\nCf. anattā, paramattha, puggala, jīva, satta.\n  \nA commentarial treatise on \"The Meaning of the Word 'Tathāgata' \" is \n  included in The All-Embracing Net of Views (Brahmajāla Sutta), tr.

XVII, is an intensified degree of craving \n(tanhā). \nThe 4 kinds of clinging are: \n\n  sensuous clinging (kāmupādāna), \n  clinging to views (ditthupādāna), \n  clinging to mere rules and ritual (sīlabbatupādāna), \n  clinging to the personality-belief (atta-vādupādāna).\n\n\n(1) \"What now is the sensuous clinging? Whatever with regard to sensuous \nobjects there exists of sensuous lust, sensuous desire, sensuous attachment, \nsensuous passion, sensuous deluded ness, sensuous fetters: this is called \nsensuous clinging.\n(2) ''What is the clinging to views? 'Alms and offerings are useless; there \nis no fruit and result for good and bad deeds: all such view and wrong \nconceptions are called the clinging to views.\n(3) \"What is the clinging to mere rules and ritual? The holding firmly to the \nview that through mere rules and ritual one may reach purification: this is \ncalled the clinging to mere rules and ritual.\n(4) \"What is the clinging to the personality-belief? The 20 kinds of \nego-views with regard to the groups of existence (s. \nsakkāya-ditthi): these are called \nthe clinging to the personality-belief\" (Dhs.1214-17).\nThis traditional fourfold division of clinging is not quite satisfactory. \nBesides kamupādāna we should expect either rūpupādāna and \narūpupādāna, or simply bhavupādāna. Though the Anāgāmī is entirely \nfree from the traditional 4 kinds of upādāna, he is not freed from \nrebirth, as he still possesses bhavupādāna. The Com. to Vis.M. XVII, in \ntrying to get out of this dilemma, explains kāmupādāna as including here \nall the remaining kinds of clinging.\n\"Clinging' is the common rendering for u., though 'grasping' would \ncome closer to the literal meaning of it, which is 'uptake'; s. Three Cardinal \nDiscourses (WHEEL 17), p.19.\n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

For purifying the \nSangha, Asoka, together with the venerable Moggaliputtatissa, summoned assembly \nof the bhikkhus. When each of the assembled was individually questioned by the \nking about what the Buddha taught, those who said that he was an eternalist \n(sassata-vadī), etc. were expelled. The genuine bhikkhus replied that the \nBuddha was a vibhajja-vadī, an 'analyst' or 'discriminating teacher'; and \nwhen, on the king's question, Moggaliputtatissa confirmed that this was the \ncorrect view, those monks were admitted to the Uposatha (q.v.) assembly of the \nSangha, and from their midst the participants of the 3rd Council at Pataliputta \nwere selected. -  \nSee Mahāvamsa, tr. by Wilh.

Its ethical and karmic character, and its greater or lesser degree of \nintensity and clarity, are chiefly determined by the mental formations \nassociated with it.\nJust like the other groups of existence, consciousness is a flux \n(viññāna-sotā,\n'stream of c.') and does not constitute an abiding mind-substance; nor is it \na transmigrating entity or soul. The 3 characteristics (s.\nti-lakkhana), impermanence, suffering \nand no-self, are frequently applied to it in the texts (e.g., in the \nAnattalakkhana Sutta, S.XXII, 59). The Buddha often stressed that \"apart from \nconditions, there is no arising of consciousness' (M 38); and all these \nstatements about its nature hold good for the entire range of consciousness, be \nit \"past, future or presently arisen, gross or subtle, in oneself or external, \ninferior or lofty, far or near\" (S. XXII, 59).\nAccording to the 6 senses it divides into 6 kinds, viz. eye- (or visual) \nconsciousness (cakkhu-v.), etc. About the dependent arising of these 6 \nkinds of consciousness, Vis.M. XV, 39 says: 'Conditioned through the eye, the \nvisible object, light and attention, eye-consciousness arises. Conditioned \nthrough the ear, the audible object, the ear-passage and attention, \near-consciousness arises. Conditioned, through the nose, the olfactive object, \nair and attention, nose-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the tongue, \nthe gustative object, humidity and attention, tongue-consciousness arises. \nConditioned through the body, bodily impression, the earth-element and \nattention, body-consciousness arises. Conditioned through the subconscious mind\n(bhavanga-mano), the mind-object and attention, mind-consciousness \narises.\"\nThe Abhidhamma literature distinguishes 89 classes of consciousness, being \neither karmically wholesome, unwholesome or neutral, and belonging either to the \nsense-sphere, the fine-material or the immaterial sphere, or to supermundane \nconsciousness.

Tab. I, 70), grasping the object and breaking through the \nsubconscious stream, performs the function of 'adverting' the mind towards the \nobject (āvajjana).\n\n\"Immediately thereupon there arises at the eye-door, and based on the \nsensitive eye-organ, the eye-consciousness, while performing the function of \n'seeing' (dassana).... Immediately thereafter there arises the \nmind-element (Tab.I, 39, 55) performing the function of 'receiving' \n(sampaticchana)\nthe object of that consciousness....\n''Immediately thereafter there arises... the mind-consciousness-element (Tab. \nI, 40, 41, 56), while 'investigating' (santirana)\nthe object received by the mind-element...\n\"Immediately thereafter there arises the functional, rootless \nmind-consciousness-element (Tab. I, 71), accompanied by indifference, while \nperforming the function of 'determining' (votthapana) the object......\n\"Now, if the object is large, then immediately afterwards there flash forth 6 \nor 7 'impulsive moments' (javana-citta), constituted by one of the 8 \nwholesome, or 12 unwholesome, or 9 functional classes of consciousness (Tab. I, \n1-8; 22-23; 72-80).\n''Now, if at the end of the impulsive moments, the object at the five-sense \ndoors is very large, and at the mind-door clear, then there arises, once or \ntwice, one of the 8 root-accompanied, karma-resultant classes of consciousness \n(Tab. I, 42-49) of the sense-sphere, or one of the 3 rootless karma-resultant \nmind-consciousness-elements (Tab. I, 40, 41, 56).... Because this consciousness \nafter the vanishing of the impulsive moments, possesses the faculty continuing \nwith the object of the sub consciousness, taking the object of the sub \nconsciousness as its own object, therefore it is called 'registering' \n(tadārarmmana,\nlit. 'that object', or 'having that as object')\" (Vis.M. XIV, 115ff).\nIf, however, the sense-object is weak, then it reaches merely the stage of \n'impulsion' (javana), or of 'determining' (votthapana); if very \nweak, only an excitation oft the sub consciousness takes place.\nThe proeess of the inner or mind-consciousness, i.e. without participation of \nthe 5 physical senses, is as follows: in the case that the mind-objeet entering \nthe mind-door is distinct, then it passes through the stages of 'advertence at \nthe mind-door' (manodvārāvajjana), the 'impulsive stage' and the \n'registering stage', before finally sinking into the subconscious stream. - \n(App.: citta-vīthi).\n  \n  Literature:  \n  \n    Aids to the Abhidhamma Philosophy, by Dr. C.B Dharmasena (with colour \n\tchart of the Cognitive Series; WHEEL 63/64).\n    The Psychology and Philosophy of Buddhism, by Dr. W.

The culmination of insight practice (s. \nvisuddhi VI) leads directly to the stages of holiness (s. visuddhi\nVII).\nInsight is not the result of a mere intellectual understanding, but is won \nthrough direct meditative observation of one's own bodily and mental processes. \nIn the commentaries and the Vis.M., the sequence in developing \ninsight-meditation is given as follows:  \n\n  1. discernment of the corporeal (rūpa), \n  2. of the mental (nāma), \n  3. contemplation of both (nāmarūpa; i.e. of their pair wise \n  occurrence in actual events, and their interdependence), \n  4. both viewed as conditioned (application of the dependent origination, \n  paticcasamuppāda), \n  5. application of the 3 characteristics (impermanency, etc.) to \n  mind-and-body-cum-conditions.\n\nThe stages of gradually growing insight are described in the 9insight- \nknowledge (vipassanā-ñāna), constituting the 6th stage of purification: \nbeginning with the 'knowledge of rise and fall' and ending with the 'adaptation \nto Truth'. For details, see visuddhi VI and Vis.M. XXI.\nEighteen chief kinds of insight-knowledge (or principal insights, \nmahā-vipassanā) are listed and described in Vis.M. XXII, 113:\n\n\n\n  (1) contemplation of impermanence (aniccānupassanā),  \n  (2) of suffering (dukkhānupassanā),  \n  (3) of no self (anattānupnupassanā),  \n  (4) of aversion (nibbidānupassanā).  \n  (5) of detachment (virāgānupassanā),  \n  (6) of extinction (nirodhānupassanā),  \n  (7) of abandoning (patinissaggānupassanā),  \n  (8) of waning (khayānupassanā),  \n  (9) of vanishing (vayānupassanā),   \n  (10) of change (viparināmānupassanā),  \n  (11) of the unconditioned (or signless, animittānupassanā),  \n  (12) of desirelessness (apanihitānupassanā),  \n  (13) of emptiness (suññatāupassanā),  \n  (14) insight into phenomena which is higher wisdom \n(adhipaññā-dhamma-vipassanā),  \n  (15) knowledge and vision according to reality (yathā-bhūta-ñānadassana),  \n  (16) contemplation of misery (or danger, ādīnavānupassanā),  \n  (17) reflecting contemplation (patisankhānupassanā),  \n  (18) contemplation of turning away (vivattanānupassanā).  \n\n\nThrough these 18, the adverse ideas and views are overcome, for which reason \nthis way of overcoming is called 'overcoming by the opposite' \n(tadanga-pahāna, \novercoming this factor by that). Thus \n\n  (1) dispels the idea of permanence.  \n  (2) the idea of happiness,  \n  (3) the idea of self,  \n  (4) lust,  \n  (5) greed,  \n  (6) origination,  \n  (7) grasping,  \n  (8) the idea of compactness,  \n  (9) karma-accumulation,  \n  (10) the idea of lastingness,  \n  (11) the conditions,  \n  (12) delight,  \n  (13) adherence,  \n  (14) grasping and adherence to the idea of substance,  \n  (15) attachment and adherence,  \n  (17) thoughtlessness,  \n  (18) dispels entanglement and clinging.  \n\nInsight may be either mundane (lokiya) \nor supermundane (lokuttara). \nSupermundane insight is of 3 kinds:  \n\n  (1) joined with one of the 4 supermundane paths,  \n  (2) joined with one of the fruitions of these paths,  \n  (3) regarding the extinction, or rather suspension, of consciousness (s. \nnirodha-samāpatti).  \n\n\nSee samatha-vipassanā, \nvisuddhi, III-VII.\nLiterature:  \n\n  \n    Manual of Insight, by Ledi Sayadaw (WHEEL 31/32).\n    \n    Practical Insight Meditation, Progress of Insight, both by Mahāsi \n\tSayadaw (BPS). \n    The Experience of Insight, by Joseph Goldstein (BPS).\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",

'Path', §64), wherein their purpose \nand goal are illustrated. There it is said that the real and ultimate goal does \nnot consist in purification of morality, or of mind, or of view, etc., but in \ntotal deliverance and extinction. Now, just as one mounts the first coach and \ntravels to the second coach, then mounts the second coach and travels with it to \nthe third coach, etc., in exactly the same way the goal of  \n\n  (I) the purification of morality (sila-visuddhi)\n  is \n  (II) the purification of mind (citta-visuddhi); its goal: \n  (III) the purification of view (ditthi-visuddhi); its goal: \n  (IV) the purification by overcoming doubt (kankhāvitarana-visuddhi); \n  its goal: \n  (V) the purification by knowledge and vision of what is path and not-path \n  (maggāmagga-ñānadassana-visuddhi);\n  its goal: \n  (VI) the purification by knowledge and vision of the path-progress \n  (patipadā-ñānadassana-visuddhi);\nits goal: \n  (VII) the purification of knowledge and vision (ñānadassana-visuddhi);\nbut the goal of this purification is deliverance freed from all clinging.\n\n(I) \"Purification of morality (sīla-visuddhi)\nconsists of the 4-fold purity of morality (catu-pārisuddhi-sīla),\nnamely: restraint with regard to the Disciplinary Code \n(pātimokkhasamvara-sīla),\nsense-restraint (indriysamvara-sīla), purity of livelihood \n(ājīvapārisuddhi-sīla),\nmorality with regard to the 4 requisites (paccaya-sannissita-sīla)\" \n(Vis.M. XVIII). On these 4 terms, s. sīla. - In the case of a layman, it \nentails the observance of whatever moral rules (5 or more) he has taken upon \nhimself.\n(II) \"Purification of mind (citta-visuddhi) is a name for the 8 \nattainments (= absorptions: jhāna, q.v.), as well as for \nneighbourhood-concentration (upacāra-samādhi; s. samādhi).\"\n(ib.).\n(III) \"By purification of view (ditthi-visuddhi) is meant the \nunderstanding, according to reality, of mind and corporeality (nāmarūpa,\nq.v.)... which is founded on undeludedness (wisdom) as base, and which in \nmanifold ways determines mind and corporeality after overcoming all belief in a \npersollality (attā: self, ego.).\" (ib.).\n(IV) \"By purification by overcoming doubt (kankhā-vitarana-visuddhi)\nis meant the understanding which, by grasping the conditions of this mind and \ncorporeality, has escaped from all doubt with regard to the 3 times (past, \npresent, future).\" (ib. XIX)\n(V) \"By purification by knowledge and vision of what is path and not-path \n(maggāmagga-ñānadassana-visuddhi) is meant that understanding which knows \nthe right path from the wrong path: 'This is the right path, that the wrong \npath.' \" (ib. XX)\nIn order to attain this 5th stage of purification, one at first should \ndevelop methodical insight (naya-vipassanā), i.e. through contemplation \nof the 5 groups of existence (khandha, q.v.). For whosoever does not yet \npossess a perfectly developed insight, to him such phenomena as effulgence of \nlight, etc. (see below), arising during insight, may become impediments in the 3 \nkinds of full understanding here considered (s. pariññā).\n'As soon as the manifold ways and characteristics of the 4 Truths (sacca) \nand the dependent origination (paticcasamuppāda)\nhave become clear to the meditating disciple, he says to himself: Thus do these \nthings never before arisen arise, and having arisen they disappear again. Thus \ndo the formations of existence ever and again arise as something quite new. But \nnot only are they something new, they are moreover also of limited duration, \nlike a dew-drop at sunrise, like a bubble, like a line drawn with a stick in the \nwater, like a mustard seed placed on the point of an arrow, or like a flash of \nlightning. Also as something unsubstantial and empty do they appear, as \njugglery, as a mirage .... Merely something subject to vanishing arises, and \nhaving arisen disappears again.' \"\nDuring such insight practice, however, may arise the 10 imperfections (or \ndefilements) of insight (vipassanūpakkilesa):\neffulgence of light (obhāsa), knowledge (ñāna), rapture (pīti),\ntranquillity (passaddhi), happiness (sukha), determination \n(adhimokkha),\nenergy (paggaha), awareness (upatthāna), delight (nikanti).\n- See Vis.M. XX, 105f. (App.).\nExcepting the last one, 'delight', they are not imperfections or defilements \nin themselves, but may become a basis for them through the arising of pride or \ndelight or by a wrong conclusion that one of the holy paths has been attained. \nHe, however, who is watchful and experienced in insight practice, will know that \nthese states of mind do not indicate attainment of the true path, but are only \nsymptoms or concomitants of insight meditation.\n\"Thus far the meditating disciple has determined 3 of the truths, namely \nwhile determining the corporeal and mental phenomena he has, through \npurification of view (ditthi-visuddhi), determined the 'truth of \nsuffering'. While grasping the conditions he has, through purification by \novercoming doubt (kankhā-vitarana-visuddhi), determined the 'truth of the \norigin of suffering'. While determining the right path, he has, through \npurification by knowledge and vision of what is path and not-path \n(maggāmagga-ñānadassana-visuddhi),\ndetermined the 'truth of the path' (leading to the extinction of \nsuffering).\"\n(VI) Purification by knowledge and vision of the path-progress \n(patipadā-ñānadassana-visuddhi) is the insight perfected in 8 kinds of \nknowledge, together with the 9th knowledge, the 'knowledge adapting itself to \ntruth'.\nBy the 8 kinds of knowledge are here meant the following, which are freed \nfrom defilements, follow the right process, and are considered as insight, \nnamely:\n\n  1. knowledge consisting in contemplation of rise and fall \n  (udayabbayānupassanā-ñāna),\n  \n  2. in contemplation of dissolution (bhangānupassanā-ñāna),\n  3. in awareness of terror (or the fearful) (bhayatūpatthānā-ñāna),\n  \n  4. in contemplation of misery (ādīnavānupassanā-ñāna),\n  \n  5. in contemplation of aversion (nibbidānupassanā-ñāna),\n  \n  6. in the desire for deliverance (muccitu-kamyatā-ñāna),\n  7. in reflecting contemplation (patisankhānupassanā-ñāna),\n  \n  8. in equanimity regarding all formations of existence \n\t(sankhārupekkhā-ñāna)\n  - which is followed by\n  9. in adaptation to truth (saccānulomika-ñāna).\n\n  \n(1) consists in the meditative observation of the 3 characteristics of \nexistence (impermanence, suffering, no self) in one's own bodily and mental \nprocesses. As long as the mind is still disturbed by the 10 imperfections (s. \nV), the 3 characteristics will not become fully clear in their true nature. Only \nwhen the mind is free from these imperfections can the characteristics be \nobserved clearly.\n(2) When through such repeated practice, knowledge and mindfulness have grown \nkeen and the bodily and mental formations become apparent quickly, at that stage \nthe phase of dissolution of these formations will become prominent.\n\"Consciousness with (e.g.) materiality as its object arises and dissolves. \nHaving reflected on that object, he contemplates the dissolution of (reflecting) \nconsciousness.\" (Pts.M. I, 57, quoted in Vis.M. XXI, 11).\nThe 8 blessings of this knowledge are: abandoning the belief in eternal \nexistence (bhava-ditthi), giving up attachment to life, constant right \napplication (of mind to meditative endeavour), a purified livelihood, overcoming \nof anxiety, absence of fear, acquisition of forbearance and gentleness, conquest \nof discontent and sensual delight (Vis.M. XXI, 28).\n(3) Knowledge consisting in awareness of terror (or fearfulness) is the \nseeing of terror in the conditions as well as the continuity of existence. For \nwhoso considers the formations as impermanent, to him the conditions of \nexistence (i.e. the karma-formations producing ever new existence) appear as \nterror, as driving towards death. Whoso considers the formations as misery, to \nhim the continuity of existence appears as terror, as something oppressive. \nWhoso considers the formations as impersonal, to him the karmaformations, as \nwell as the continuity of existence, appear as terror, as an empty village, as a \nmirage, etc.\n(4) Contemplation of misery (or danger) is another aspect of the awareness of \nterror: \"The origin (of existence) is terror ... continuance of existence is \nterror ... arising is suffering', such understanding in the awareness of terror \nis the knowledge of misery. 'Non-arising is bliss', this is knowledge of the \npeaceful state (Pts.M. I, 59); that is, the no-more-arising is safety, is \nhappiness, is Nibbāna.\n(5) Contemplation of aversion means: aversion for all formations as terror, \ntherefore its name 'awareness of terror' has come into use. Because it has made \nknown the misery of all these formations, therefore it has received the name of \n'contemplation of misery' (ādīnavānupassanā).\nBecause it has arisen through aversion for those formations, therefore it is \nknown as 'contemplation of aversion' (nibbidānupassanā).\n\n(6) Knowledge consisting in the desire for deliverance means: the desire for \nfreedom and escape from all formations of existence.. For feeling aversion for \nall formations, becoming weary of them, finding no more delight in them, the \nmind does not cling to a single one of all these formations.\n(7) Reflecting contemplation is the repeated meditative discernment of the \nformations of existence, attributing to them the 3 characteristics of existence, \nwith the desire to find deliverance from all forms of existence.\n(8) Equanimity regarding all formations: \"When the meditator (through \nreflecting contemplation) has discerned the formations by applying the 3 \ncharacteristics to them and sees them as void, he abandons both terror and \ndelight, and becomes indifferent and equanimous with regard to all formations; \nhe neither takes them as I nor as 'mine'; he is like a man who has divorced his \nwife\" (Vis.M. XXI, 61).\n \nNow, while continuing to contemplate the 3 characteristics of existence and \nperceiving the tranquil lot of Nibbāna as the peace, this equanimity-knowledge \nbecomes the triple gateway to liberation. As it is said (Pts.M. II, p. 48):\n\"Three gateways to liberation (vimokkha-mukha; s.\n\nvimokkha I) lead to escape from the world, namely: that the mind is \ncontemplating all formations as limited, and is rushing forward to the condition \nless element (animitta-dhātu); that the mind is stirred with regard to \nall formations of existence, and is rushing forward to the desire less element \n(appanihita-dhātu); that the mind sees all things as something foreign, and \nis rushing forward to the void element (suññatā-dhātu).\"\n\nAt this stage, and through the triple gateway, the diversification of path \nattainment takes place, according to the 7 kinds of noble persons \n(ariya-puggala, q.v.); on this see Vis.M. XXI, 74ff.\nThe 6th, 7th and 8th knowledge, according to Vis.M. XXI, form really only one \nsingle knowledge in its first, middle and final stages of development. This \nknowledge is also known as the 'insight leading to path ascent' \n(vutthāna-gāminī-vipassanā, q.v.).\n(9) Adaptation to truth (or conformity with truth) is called that knowledge \nwhich, while contemplating impermanency, etc. adapts itself to the preceding 8 \nkinds of insight-knowledge, as well as to the immediately following supermundane \npath and to the 37 elements pertaining to enlightenment \n(bodhipakkhiya-dhamma, q.v.). It is identical with adaptation-knowledge (anulomañāna).\n\n\"Whosoever has cultivated, developed, and frequently practised 'equanimity \nregarding all formations' in him arises very strong faith known as determination \n(adhimokkha-saddhā) and his energy is better exerted, his mindfulness better \nestablished, his mind better concentrated, and a still stronger 'equanimity \nregarding the formations' arises. 'Now the path will reveal itself', thus \nthinking, the meditator contemplates with his equanimity-knowledge all \nformations as impermanent, etc., and thereafter that knowledge sinks into the \nsubconscious stream of existence (s. bhavanga-sotā). Immediately afterwards there arises advertence at the mind-door (s. \nviññāna-kicca).\nAnd just like equanimity-knowledge, the adaptation-knowledge, too, takes as its \nobject the formations, regarding them as something impermanent, miserable and \nimpersonal. Thereupon, while continuing the uninterrupted continuity of \nconsciousness (citta-santati), there arises the 1st impulsive moment \n(javana,\nq.v.), called 'preparation' (parikamma), taking the same formations as \nobject. Immediately thereafter, with the same formations as object, there arises \nthe 2nd impulsive moment, known as 'access' (upacāra). And again \nimmediately after that, there arises the impulsive moment called 'adaptation' \n(anuloma).\"\n(VII) Purification of knowledge and vision (ñānadassana-visuddhi)\nis the knowledge associated with any of the 4 kinds of supermundane \npath-consciousness (s. ariyapuggala).\n\n\"Immediately upon this adaptation-knowledge there arises the \n'maturity-knowlege' (gotrabhū-ñāna; s. gotrabhū) taking as object \nthe Unconditioned, the standstill of existence, the absence of becoming, \ncessation, Nibbāna, while at the same time transcending the rank (gotta = gotra: \nlineage), designation and plane of the worldling (puthujjana, q.v.), and \nentering the rank, designation and plane of the Noble Ones (ariya), being \nthe first turning towards Nibbāna as object, the first thinking of it, the first \nconcentration on it, and the condition for the path ... forming the culmination \nof insight, and never as such coming back again.\n''As the immediate continuation following upon that maturity knowledge \n(gotrabhū-ñāna), there arises the first path-consciousness (Stream-entrance) \nforever destroying the first 3 of the 10 fetters of existence (samyojana, q.v.), and closing the entrance to the lower worlds. Immediately after this \npath-knowledge, there arise, as its result, 2 or 3 path-produced states of \nconsciousness, the fruitional consciousness (phala-citta). Immediately \nafter the sinking of this consciousness into the subconscious stream of \nexistence, the retrospective knowledge (paccavekkhana-ñāna, q.v.) arises, \nhaving the path-consciousness as its object\" (Vis.M. XXI). For the 3 higher \npaths, s. ariya-puggala.\n\nEach of the 4 kinds of path-consciousness performs at the one and the same \ntime 4 functions, namely: the function of full understanding (pariññā,\nq.v.) of suffering, the function of overcoming (pahāna, q.v.) the origin \nof suffering, the function of realizing (sacchikiriyā) the extinction of \nsuffering, the function of developing (bhāvanā, q.v.) the supermundane \nNoble Eightfold Path (magga, q.v.).\nSee Path of Purification, by Buddhaghosa, tr. by Ñyanamoli (BPS); Path of \nFreedom, by Upatissa (BPS).\n  \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n",
