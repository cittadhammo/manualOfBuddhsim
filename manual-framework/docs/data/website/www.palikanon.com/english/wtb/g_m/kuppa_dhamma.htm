<p>&#39;liable to perturbation&#39;, is one who has not yet attained full mastery 
over the absorptions.  </p>
<p>In Pug. 3 it is said:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What person is liable to perturbation? Such a person gains the attainments 
of the fine-material and immaterial sphere (s. <i>avacara).</i> But he does not 
gain them at his wish, nor without toil and exertion; and not at his wish as 
regards place, object and duration, does he enter them or arise from them. Thus 
it is well possible that in case of such a person, through negligence, the 
attainments will become perturbed. This person is liable to perturbation.&quot;</p>
